								<p><b>Hachioji Park Sat 15th April 2006.</b> YCACs miserable end of season run continued with its 3rd consecutive defeat, this time in the FJC semi final handing victors, The Swiss, a shot at a 3rd Cup win and, presumably, the right to keep the Trophy outright.<br>
									<br>
									1-0 was the score. A scrambled winner right at the death but in truth it was only the heroics of Gary the (YCAC) Goalkeeper that kept this one close. The only point at which YCAC looked like they might scrape it was 40 minutes before KO when, with 14 YCAC men kitted out and warming up, only Suzuki was on hand for the Swiss. History didnt repeat itself though and once his teammates arrived the chance had gone.<br>
									<br>
									For the 3rd week in a row YCAC failed to trouble the scorers or even to create any worthwhile chances, their goal scoring&nbsp;attempts being limited to some fierce drives from distance from Kenny&nbsp;Kaneko who had a bright game in general. Swiss Keeper Peter Pauli, apparently a little put out by the inference in the report of last weeks game that he didnt earn his corn, decided to actively seek work and was actually sighted on the edge of his own area collecting the ball. According to spectator Stephen Harmony Bradshaw, ever the keen student of the finer points of the beautiful game, the highest Peter had been spotted up the pitch since records began. Some sort of plaque should be laid at the spot, perhaps.<br>
									<br>
									The Swiss played 3-5-2, a cunning plan designed to counter the threat of YCACs Anthony Savage. Anthony was in England on holiday. Bluff or counter bluff? No matter. YCAC, only vaguely aware that its&nbsp;midfield was being overrun, didnt spot the difference anyway. TML Captains; A battle of wits between&nbsp;unarmed opponents<br>
									<br>
									Hats off to Kirk and ageing playboy Trevor Vail, dominant at the back for the Swiss. I SAID WELL PLAYED TREV, YOU&quot;RE A MARVEL FOR YOUR AGE!!&nbsp; I SAID...oh never mind. Both Swissies&nbsp;were shaded for MOM by Gary in the YCAC goal, though<br>
									<br>
									A good game from Ref Riuri too, breaking some new ground in managing to shut Karl up. Maybe a plaque on that spot too? Too many plaques on the surface might cause uneven bounce of the ball, though. We dont want to reopen that wound so we'll put Karls towel there on the off chance that we'll use the space later..<br>
