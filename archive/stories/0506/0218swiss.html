								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 18th February 2006.</b> A chilly day at YCAC saw the Swiss Kickers line up vs. this year&rsquo;s run-away league leaders, Hibs., in the quarterfinal of the Cup.&nbsp; The Hibs. were missing their captain due to suspension while the Swiss were short in defense due to injuries. &nbsp;Other than that, both teams were essentially at full strength. &nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									The first half saw a stronger Hibs. side with a solid midfield pushing the Swiss back into their end and only poor finishing to blame for not going ahead 1 or 2 goals as the pressure was mostly one way.&nbsp; The Swiss were playing it safely out of the back but were having difficulty connecting with new man Yan, and Karl up front seemingly stranded.&nbsp; The bouncy pitch at YCAC was clearly helping the Swiss on the day as the clean passing of the speedy Hibs. front line was being slowed by the bobbles.&nbsp; The first half ended 0-0 with the Swiss defense having held up under the pressure.&nbsp; James Batten had one good effort saved by Hitoshi diving to his right but shots by Josh, Keita, Tomo, Naoki, all clear, were just knocked over the target and Peter didn&rsquo;t have much to do in the first half.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The second half started to see a little bit better action from the Swiss as Kai was pushed up front (after having been held up by a hangover and a train stoppage in Omori). &nbsp;His speed caused a few problems for the Hibs and his cross led to a great volley from man of the match Dave Pratt that just barely missed the left post.&nbsp; The game opened up a little but also became more physical as Dave and central midfield marauder Jay had a few memorable challenges.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									The game was pretty well balanced until about 20 minutes gone. &nbsp;A free kick sent in by Cho from midfield bounced through the 6 yard area, something which almost never happens with Hitoshi in the Hibs. goal, and was knocked in at the far post by a smiling Dave Pratt.&nbsp; <br>
									A bit of luck for the Swiss and all to play for with 20 minutes to go.&nbsp; The Hibs. started to raise the intensity with Yohei working hard on the right hand side and Keita trying to pound it through the middle, a lot of chances were there to be taken.&nbsp; The Swiss midfield worked tirelessly and the defense held up, even Peter in goal rose up to claim a few very dangerous crosses. &nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									In the end, a hard fought 1-0 win for the Swiss and progress on to the semi-final of the Cup.&nbsp; This was a quality game and too bad it was played so early on in the competition.<br>
