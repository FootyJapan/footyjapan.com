					<p><b>Ueno Gakuin, 17th Oct, 2004.</b> Beautiful sunshine set the scene for the 22nd Scottish Highland Games in Soka City with around one and a half housand people there on the day. As usual the 5-a-side football, organized again by <a class="txtlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com" target="_blank">Footy Japan</a>, attracted a huge following, with 23 teams competing in the 1066 Cup &amp; masters Cup.<br>Last Year the Final was won by Sala FC defeating KFC 3-1 in the 1066 Cup. This year the final was between the same 2 teams, but KFC took it with a 4-1 victory in yet another tough battle between 2 fierce competitors.<br>
						The Masters tournament saw the introduction of female players for the first time, Onnabelievable FC, who managed a draw putting them 3rd in their group. The final was an all British affair between BFC Masters &amp; BFC Vagabonds Masters; all of whom play regularly together as an 11 a side team. No punches were pulled though and the very even match was decided by one of the all time dodgiest goals ever given. The referee must have been using his 1966 Russin goggles to award the Vags masters a goal after a fine save from Gus 'the cat', but wouldn't budge on his decision despite pleas &amp; groans from the sideline. Video footage is not conclusive, but the cameraman is holding out for more money before handing over the tape to any of the BFC. Still the goal stood and Vags Masters won 2-1, leading to some heated discussions over copious amounts of beer later!<br>
