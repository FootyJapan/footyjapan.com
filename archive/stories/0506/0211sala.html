								<p><b>OiFuto Sat 11th February 2006.</b> Two early goals and a resolute second half defensive display were enough for Sala to sneak into the cup semis after a tight game at Oifuto.<br>
									<br>

									Missing several regulars and fielding a couple of debutants, Sala didn&rsquo;t take long to gel, with Toby netting possibly the fastest goal in the chequered history of the club inside 3 minutes.<br>
									Lenny was first to claim the assist after the game (This writer was momentarily distracted and in the spirit of journalism didn&rsquo;t bother to ask anyone about it afterwards. When are they going to get those giant video screens at Oifuto?), so history will remember that it was his through ball that set Toby a&rsquo;scampering.<br>
									As Brookey voiced his sage advice from the touchline &ldquo;TAKE IT %$#%*G ROUND HIM!&rdquo; Toby assuredly slotted it past the keeper with the outside of his left boot. 1v0<br>
									The second didn&rsquo;t take long to come, with the Geckoes defence at sixes and sevens, possibly even eights, Jason stole in undetected to slot home Dhugal&rsquo;s flick on from about ten yards out. 2v0<br>

									Sala racked up chance after chance in the first half, with goal heroes Jason and Toby both guilty of missing chances easier than the ones they had previously tucked away. Dhugal, obviously feeling left out of the &lsquo;passing up gilt edged opportunities club&rsquo; also got in on the act. A free-kick from the right drifted temptingly his way, he leapt beautifully, beating his marker and making good contact, only for the ball to end up a good ten yards wide. There were some &lsquo;Toblerone head&rsquo; comments made after the game, but this writer would like to distance himself from such crassness&#x2026;&lsquo;Pizza Slice head&rsquo; is a much better description.<br>
										Sala let Geckoes back in after about half an hour, when the Sala defence went to sleep for the only time in the game and left the trouser clad Gecko alone in the box. He was picked out with a decent pass, and gave Sid no chance from close range.2v1<br>
									<br>
									In the second half, Geckoes threw everything forward, but couldn&rsquo;t unlock Sala&rsquo;s tight defence.<br>
									
									Andres kept the heads above water in the midfield with a battling display,as did Dhugal and Brian in the deeper strikers role. Lenny and Giles kept things moving forward, and teenage sensation Yasuhiro came on to make a sparkling, albeit short, debut.<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/06/0211sala4.jpg" alt="" height="161" width="220" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">
									His neat link-up play and first time passes suggested he has more to offer, but on Saturday he settled for a couple of shots that were well saved by the Blue&rsquo;s keeper.<br>
									But it was at the back that the best work was done by Sala. The twin towers of Steve and Doug were indefatigable. Evan put in a good shift on the left and Guido was, as ever, everywhere.<br>
									Asides a few late counters though, Sala were on the back foot, until the last kick of the ball in the second half, but Sid never looked in any real danger.<br>
									Toby summed up Sala&rsquo;s resolve with the last touch of the game, coming back from upfront to head clear a dangerous free-kick, despite the chaos around him.<br>
									Better attitude, better movement and a better performance.<br>
