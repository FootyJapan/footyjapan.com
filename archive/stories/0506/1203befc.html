								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 3rd December 2005.</b> Penalties  are always a bad way to lose a cup tie and no more so than the fixture  between the British Embassy and France FC at YCAC.<br>
									Make no mistake about it, this was a  good game of football between two sides determined to make a go of it and  reach the next round of the FJ cup.<br>
									<br>
									However, it was a French striker who came to France FC&rsquo;s rescue with a scrappy equalizer to  keep them in the tournament. <br>
									The forward struck just before half time, toe poking home after a goal line scramble, with BEFC defender Sendo desperately unlucky not  to clear.<br>
									BEFC went in front quite early on with new Embassy  striker Steve Lidbury controlling a long ball, before turning inside a defender and firing across the French keeper for his first goal for the club.&nbsp; He looked pretty pleased with himself too and so he should have, for it was a  peach of a goal.<br>
									<br>
									Both sides played neat, full flowing football and the  game was played in good spirits. &nbsp;The midfield area was hotly contested as  expected with both teams trying to find that all important foot hold from  which to spring their attacks. &nbsp;Paul &lsquo;Biffa&rsquo; Bacon in  particular was in commanding form for the Embassy.<br>
									The defenders for both clubs worked their socks off and gave very little away. Tim Marchand and Keith Crowley had outstanding  games for the BEFC.&nbsp; With both sides playing so tightly, it was  inevitable that this game would finish a draw and so to penalties.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									The French went on to win the shoot out and probably deserve their win&#x2026;..just.&nbsp; For BEFC this was more of a hard luck story than the same old story.&nbsp;<br>
									The referee should also be commended for his performance on the day and for keeping foul play and foul language to a minimum. &nbsp;Both  Mike Yeomans and Steve Lidbury were penalized for swearing early on, but that  was it.<br>
									<br>
									<b>Man of the match:&nbsp; Steve Lidbury (BEFC) </b>for his  cracking first goal and constant work rate.<b><br>
