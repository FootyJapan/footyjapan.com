								<p><b>Hachioji Park Sun 30th April 2006.</b> Sala suffered a heartbreaking third loss on penalties in two weeks, as France continued to hold the evil eye over them with three victories this season alone.<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/06/0430semi2.jpg" alt="" height="189" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">The manner of defeat was all the more disheartening. Sala struck the woodwork on three occasions and rarely looked threatened until the golden goal period of extra time. <br>
									France failed to hit the target with a single shot, but somehow went ahead in the tenth minute when Colombian enforcer Andres headed a corner into his own net. It was a novel way for Sala to lose an early goal, seemingly giving away penalties for handball has gone out of fashion.<br>
									Sala burst into life in the first minute, when Lenny&rsquo;s pinpoint cross picked out Charles who had sleepwalked between the snoozing French defense. Charles met the ball on the half volley from the edge of the box but his effort cannoned straight back off the bar as the bemused French keeper stood rooted to the spot.<br>
									Sala continued to pour on the pressure with Shigeru, Toby and Jason all going close. But France took the lead against the run of play with Andres&rsquo; spectacular own goal. You should have seen the look on Sid&rsquo;s face!<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/06/0430semi3.jpg" alt="" height="231" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">Ten minutes later, Toby picked up Jason&rsquo;s throw and turned well taking the ball into the box where he was unceremoniously dumped on his behind.<br>
									Clarkey stepped up and side-footed the kick home to level the scores. It wasn&rsquo;t to be the last he&rsquo;d take that day.<br>
									The second half saw Sala rack up chance after chance, whilst defending resolutely to mop up French counter attacks.<br>
									Clarkey smashed a great chance onto the crossbar from six yards after Dhugal&rsquo;s header was cleared off the line. Shigeru saw his angled shot touched onto the post by the French keeper.<br>
									Dhugal and Shigeru&rsquo;s direct running was causing the ad-hoc French defense all kinds of trouble, with at least three players booked for fouls on Shigeru alone.<br>
									Jason and Toby also passed up good chances to win the game, and it began to get ominous that Sala would be made to pay for their lax finishing.<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/06/0430semi4.jpg" alt="" height="128" width="139" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">Towards the end Andres curled a lovely free kick just over from thirty yards and so it went to a golden goal showdown.<br>
									France did well to rally their troops and came back into it during the fifteen minute period of extra time, but it was for the most part, a turgid affair.<br>
									And so to penalties&#x2026; Clarkey abstained from choosing a side and ended up hitting the crossbar right in the centre of the goal. Andres, Guido, Toby and Lenny scored with their shots, but it wasn&rsquo;t to be as France went perfect, and Sala said goodbye to the cup at the semi-final stage.<br>
									Blimey.<br>
