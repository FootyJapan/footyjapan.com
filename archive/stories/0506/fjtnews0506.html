															The manner of defeat was all the more disheartening. Sala struck the woodwork on three occasions and rarely looked threatened until the golden goal period of extra time.<br>
															France failed to hit the target with a single shot, but somehow went ahead in the tenth minute when Colombian enforcer Andres headed a corner into his own net. It was a novel way for Sala to lose an early goal, seemingly giving away penalties for handball has gone out of fashion.. <a class="txtlink" href="0430fjsemi2.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

														<p><b>Yurakucho Sat 25th February 2006.</b> At the Eigotown Intenational Party, under the watchful eye of Ref Ruairi &amp; BFC Captain Brian Doyle, the draw for the semi-finals of the FJ Cup was made. In a rematch of last years final, TML Division 1's 2nd &amp; 3rd places teams, Swiss Kickers &amp; YC&amp;AC were drawn against each other, leaving France FC and Sala FC to do battle in the other Semi. France have had the upperhand in both matches against Sala this season, while Swiss drew 1 all with YC&amp;AC in their only meeting so far. The semi finals will be scheduled for the end of March/beginning April.<br>

														<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 4th December 2005.</b> Rather less exciting was the the Cup match between YCAC1 and Stoneds that afternoon. YCAC waltzed past the Visitors on a wet and slippery surface. Goals from James Absolom (2), Jumpei Ueda and Will Brady gave the home team a comfortable 4-0 victory. Any hopes Stoneds were harbouring of&nbsp;causing an upset were stillborn as they kicked off with 9 men and didn't reach their full complement of 11 until 3/4 of the way through the match.<br>
															<br>
															Captain Steve Taw looks like he'll be spending the next few weeks with his leg in Plaster. He broke it after getting his studs caught up in the uneven turf of YCAC, the cause of many an ankle injury. He'll be happier having heard of the plans for the new artificial turf to go in next year no doubt.<br>

Gutter-mouth Tui (44) a native of the New Zealand country, audibly muttered a four letter word beginning with F (and not the place where cows and sheep live!) after he felt a pass to him could have been more thoughtfully placed.<br>
															Wing king Lenny was lucky to escape a caution as the red mist descended midway through the second half, when Clarkey set him up to shoot on his unknown right foot rather than his favoured left peg. Tui&rsquo;s invective was primarily aimed at Clarkey but he kept some in store for himself as his shot from 8 yards flew over. <a class="txtlink" href="1203sala.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>
