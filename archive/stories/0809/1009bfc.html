									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 9th November.</b> <br>
										El Tank' Carlos Aranda's first goal in BFC's 8-0 evisceration of the Wall Street Clash prompted one of the two-man crowd to remark: 'That's not very sporting is it!'<br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/08/1109bfc3.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="258" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">By that point BFC were already a goal to the good thanks to Sahara, whose close-range shot trickled inside the post after a goal-mouth scramble. Aranda's goal was struck with proper venom though, raging into the back of the net from 30 metres.<br>
										<br>
										When the Paraguayan hits 'em, they stay hit. The poor Clash goalkeeper needed oven mitts to pick the ball out of the net.<br>
										<br>
										With Clarke and Sahara putting the fear of God into the Clash defenders a third was on the cards and duly came when Wall Street failed to clear a corner and the ball fell for that man again -- Aranda smashing it home from eight yards out.<br>
										<br>
										As sweetly as he bashes a football, post-match talk predictably turned to the beginnings of a mullet creeping down to Aranda's collar. 'El Mulleto' it will be then unless the big guy takes immediate action. For the record, they have not heard of Chris Waddle in Ascuncion.<br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/08/1109bfc2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="235" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Day cheekily claimed the fourth, Saco's cross flicked over the keeper by Himmer, the ball dropping just over the line via the crossbar before the former BFC captain made extra, extra sure. In the absence of goal-line technology, Day launched himself and the ball into the back of the net like a spawning salmon and 4-0 at halftime it remained.<br>
										<br>
										Evans made it 5-0, hooking the ball home after Clarke's superb raking ball had been knocked down by Himmer at the back post. Remember little else -- Day curling a shot onto the bar, Yamagishi going on a mazy run and firing weakly at the keeper with BFC's three strikers all wide open, Morson and Manson charging up the pitch trying to inject some urgency into BFC's second-half display ...<br>
										<br>
										Final three goals -- gone blank. Apologies to those who scored them. Will use the space instead to give credit to the Clash, who played the game in a great spirit and never raised a stud in anger despite taking a hiding.<br>
										<br>
										Also to Paul, who refereed excellently and with good humour, after one slightly questionable offside, anticipating the obvious, he turned and said: 'You can have a pop if you want!' Defused with a wink and a smile. Top stuff.<br>
										<br>
										Do feel free to add goal details if you wish chaps ... Bonjour!<b><br>
