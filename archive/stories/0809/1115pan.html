									<p><b>Nagahama Koen, Sat 15th November.</b><br>
										Mid week the Carling Cup teams met to decide who goes into the last 8. Obviously Burnley did a little more than upset the apple cart against Chelsea&rsquo;s million pound superstars. Obviously we are not comparing ourselves to Chelsea (or even Burnley for the matter!!) but there was a similarity in the method of player selection.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										Our leader Romen &lsquo;Benitez&rsquo; Baura had indeed done some fantastic mid season transfer deals and we received three fresh new players to help the Panther&rsquo;s Cup cause. Thankfully none of them were cup tied and provided the added verve needed to put our first game to bed! Especially since all our division one players had abandoned us in favour of their &lsquo;better&rsquo; teams!!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										To the game!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The first half was pretty split in terms of possession with the Panthers probably edging the percentage slightly. The movement from both teams was indeed impressive, quick decisive passing with some excellent balls through to the strikers of both teams. Both team&rsquo;s defensive displays were equal to the others attack and it was going to take a bit of luck or incredible skill to break through. Sadly we are lacking in the skill department (we are in division 3!!) but the luck came in barrels, a left footed lofted cross came in from Scott careening down the left wing in towards Tom who didn&rsquo;t even need to touch it as it slotted in over our ex-keeper Tomo. The deadlock had been broken and the game started flowing a lot more as Y-abe put the pressure on to return thing to an even footing.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										To compare Mikhail, our substitute goalie to Tottenham&rsquo;s Gomez would be unfair&#x2026;&#x2026;.. but surprisingly accurate. Mikhail, not content with catching balls that came near him, he decided the best plan was to swat the balls as if bugs into the path of oncoming strikers or off for a corner. With this added pressure we were bound to concede eventually and what can only be rhymed with bluster cuck we conceded a goal. Saying that Mikhail did a grand job and we are grateful especially as no-one else wanted to do it!!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Still we were happy to go into the second half even Stevens, it was still all to play for. In order to develop his nick name further Romen Benitez subbed some players, good job he did as shortly after that the team was hit by some kind of virus that gave half the team cramp, maybe it was the &ldquo;very soft, fluffy, not TML like at all&rdquo; grass!!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The subs kept pouring from the Y-abe side of the touch line and it started to look like the Panthers would run out of steam before they managed to scrape something from the game. Then we went through a renaissance and the team played liked they never have before. Our South American midfield duo passed their way through the midfield like Chelsea against Hull! This led to Yuseppe not only scoring once, but three times, each getting better than the last. It could have even been four had their defender not blocked a shot from the six yard box with an arm conceding a penalty. Romen called for Tom to take the penalty, Yuseppe picked up and placed the ball and Mikhail walked over and shot the ball into the keepers hands. The most bizarre of penalties!! Still, Tom needed a goal and an amazingly well placed shot from 30 yards out screamed to the top right corner of the goal. We started celebrating as Tomo flew through the air and parried it over the bar. The place was silent as every member of both teams stood with their jaw dropped to the floor! Not to be denied a goal Tom managed a shot and deflection giving us a 5-1 win and a place in the last 16 of the Cup!<br>
