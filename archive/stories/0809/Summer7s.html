													<img src="../../../photos/09/2009Summer7s/S7s1.jpg" alt="" height="246" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Scorching weather, hot football and the occasional hot temper is the best way to describe this years Footy Japan Summer 7's as 20 teams fought hard in the blistering heat of the Tokyo Summer to the chance to be crowned 7's champions. This years competition saw half the teams being members of the <b><a class="txtlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/index.html">Tokyo Metropolis League</a></b> but the other half 'unknown' teams introduced in part by YCAC's Joe Takeda. And it was 2 of these non-league teams who ended up in the Cup Final, while 2 <b>TML</b> teams played out the Bowl final. <br>
													With 20 teams in the competition, it meant each group comprising 5 teams would have to compete for a spot in the knock-out stages , leaving 1 unfortunate to stay rooted within the group and to contemplate an early, hot journey home. Two of the early favorites - New Year 7's Champs <b>NSP</b> and Charity 7's Champs <b><a class="txtlink" href="../../../pages/fj_select.html">Footy Japan</a></b> were paired together in Group A, while Magnificent 7's front-runners <b>YCAC</b> and <b>BFC</b> were both grouped with unknown but Young &amp; fit looking Japanese teams. <br>
													<img src="../../../photos/09/2009Summer7s/S7s3.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">Also present were 2 US base teams from <b>Atsugi</b> &amp; <b>Yokota</b> who can never be underestimated (with good reason) so it seemed like the line-up of teams was the strongest seen at any Footy Japan 7's tournament so far. <br>
													In the group stage most of the 'expected' teams made it through to the cup - <b>BFC</b>, <b>YCAC</b>, <b>NSP</b> with the exception of Footy Japan who looked quite disappointing with losses to <b>Sala</b> and <b>Atsugi</b> though they surprised an already qualified <b>NSP</b> in the final group match beating them 3-1 (experience conquering age!) The <b>Shane</b> machine were present in numbers, sporting 2 teams who both fought their way into the bowl competition despite the absence of talisman Neil Lennon who'd been Shanghai'd. Their presence in the plate was short lived though, both teams being ousted in the quarter finals, though it looked like that may have just been a good excuse for them to get the beers in! <br>
													The <b>British Embassy</b> kept a pretty low profile all day as they worked their way into the final of the Bowl meeting fellow Division 2 team <b>El Diego</b>, who'd just had the longest Penalty shoot-out ever to see of non league <b>Hongo FC</b> 7-6. <br>
													<img src="../../../photos/09/2009Summer7s/S7s4.jpg" alt="" height="241" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">It was the neat, accurate passing game of <b>El Diego</b> that persevered, coming out 2-0 winners for their 2nd silverware of the year following the Div 3 Champions Cup. <br>
													It was in the cup competition where all the upsets really began. <b>YCAC</b> who'd won their group with 13 points, 4 wins, 7 goals for and none against, were systematically taken apart by <b>Yokohama Soccer &amp; Culture Club</b> with a 3-0 deciding margin. <b>British FC</b> who'd also had a decent group record, came unstuck against <b>FC Bon Bon</b> with a 1-0 loss, the same score as <b>NSP</b> defeated <b>FC International</b>. Sparks were flying in the other quarter final where Variatore unhinged the squad from <b>Atsugi</b> Base 2-0 but they fell foul to <b>FC Bon Bon</b> in the Semis while the young lads from NSP were also given a lesson by <b>YSCC</b>. So the Finals were between <b>YSCC</b> and <b>FC Bon Bon</b> and it was the former who had most of the play although both teams had some good chances. Due to time constraints, there was no extra time and so at the end of normal time when the score was still tied 1 each, penalties beckoned. <br>
													<img src="../../../photos/09/2009Summer7s/S7s5.jpg" alt="" height="195" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">The very first penalty turned out to be the decider, when the <b>FC Bon Bon</b> player hit the post. All the rest of the takers hit the mark leaving <b>YSCC</b> victorious, including a very audacious 'reverse' kick - sorry I don't even know how to describe someone kicking a ball from outside their left leg using their right foot (coming around the back of the left leg). Lucky for him it worked otherwise the large crowd (already half drunk) would have taken him to the &lsquo;Crowd banter&rsquo; cleaners <br>
													So there it was, the new boys YSCC crowned champions, another 7's tournament wrapped up, many bright pink faces hitting the showers (some pink from sun, others from alcohol).<br>
													<b>Thanks to all those who helped make this another great tournament, especially the referees who spent a full 8 hours out in the blazing sunshine - without referees, it's impossible to run these kinds of events!!</b><br>
