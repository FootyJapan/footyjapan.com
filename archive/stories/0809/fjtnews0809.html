															For the second year in a row, the Footy Japan select team bowed out in the semi-finals of the Tesco Lotus Bangkok 7's, this year at the hands of the All Star team.<br>
															An Ian Rush goal was all that separated the 2 teams after a tight match in which Lee Sharpe hit the upright and a shot from FJ's USAF pilot 'Juice', rolled agonizingly past the post.&nbsp; <a class="txtlink" href="bkk7s.html" target="_blank">More...</a><br>

														<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 3rd May.</b><br>
															Whaam bam thank you maam sums up a calamitous almost frightfully hard fought plate semi affair between the div 1 underachievers Sala and their opposition div 2 landsliders FC Int. The sultry conditions served up a plate full of steamy action culminating in a 1 &#150; 1 deadlock at the end of normal time, only for Sala to clinch the deal on penalties 4 &#150; 2.&nbsp; <a class="txtlink" href="0502sala.html" target="_blank">More...</a><br>

																Friday, March 20th 2009.</b><br>
															The new 3rd generation astroturf pitch at <b>YC&amp;AC </b>was the saviour of this years Charity tournament after torrential rain hit as the captains were about to make the draw. Players ran for cover, schedules, league table &amp; other paperwork got soaked, but once the rain was over, unlike last year the playing surface was immaculate.<br>
															17 teams battled it out over 8 hours but it was Division 1 strugglers, British Embassy FC and Footy Japan's own BFA coaches who walked off with the Silverware.<br>
															Remarkably, even in these times of economic recession we were still able to raise over <b>&yen;300,000</b> for <b><a class="txtlink" href="../../../photos/09/C7s/jbcfinfo.pdf" target="_blank">Billy &amp; Jeannie&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Foundation</a></b>, thanks to all those who showed support<b>.</b>&nbsp; <a class="txtlink" href="charity7s.html" target="_blank"><b>More...</b></a><br>

														<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 7th March.</b><br>
															Just as Alex Ferguson&rsquo;s Man Utd&nbsp;are still in the running to win five trophies this season, so the Hibs remain alive to win three trophies after bagging the Phuket crown and still in with a great chance in the cup and league, after this hard fought, if not slightly dreary win over a spritely Geckoes.&nbsp; <a class="txtlink" href="0307hibs.html" target="_blank">More...</a><br>

															<br>
															Like a bygone hero of old, brave 3rd Division King George went into this TML Plate match looking to kill some monstrous 1st Division opposition.&nbsp; Although Sala weren't exactly monstrous on the night, they did have big enough gnashers to crush their opponents 4-0 and spit out the pieces that were left.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

															The Clash advanced to the semi-finals of the TML Plate following a 5-3 victory over the Barbarians.<br>
														A cold and wet Sunday evening in Yokohama provided the backdrop for a compelling cup tie.&nbsp; Having shared nine goals in their last encounter, this game was always likely to provide plenty of goals.&nbsp; And so it proved.&nbsp; <a class="txtlink" href="0301rwc.html" target="_blank">More...</a><br>

														First, the captaincy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monday afternoon drama series&nbsp;that Sala's captaincy had become was finally laid to rest on Sunday.&nbsp; After much hemming and hawing, Brookey decided that he was too busy and that it was time to step down and focus on his hair.&nbsp; And so, Guido &quot;The G-man&quot; Geisler returned to captain Sala once again and bring some much needed buoyancy to a close-to-sinking Sala ship.&nbsp; <a class="txtlink" href="0125sala.html" target="_blank">More...</a><br>

														Vagabonds demolished Maritizio 2-0 in their best performance of the season at Hachioji park. Maritizio didn't get a single shot on target, Vagabonds countless. <br>
														<br>
														Mother nature provided us with a squad of fifteen players, raging with insecurity about so long without a win.

Beating YCAC in the quarters, they went on to beat TML Div 1 Champs BFC 2-0 in a thrilling final.

													<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 15th November.</b><br>
														Despite all their best efforts, the TML think-tank was unable to get their hands on the complex formula used by FIFA to seed world cup teams and were forced to construct their own system for Footy Japan cup seedings. Once the results were spat out of TMLs own equation, YCAC 2nds were considered a stronger team than YACAC 1s; and sure enough, the two leading contenders for the 08/09 TML crown were drawn to face off in the first round of the cup. <a class="txtlink" href="1115hibs.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

Sun. The Barbs opponents&rsquo; spot in their division&rsquo;s table didn&rsquo;t strike fear into their hearts and despite their decent size for a Local squad they went into the game somewhat confident with a core of regulars and a handful of subs. <a class="txtlink" href="1108baba.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

														By that point BFC were already a goal to the good thanks to Sahara, whose close-range shot trickled inside the post after a goal-mouth scramble.
