									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 15th November.</b><br>
										Despite all their best efforts, the TML think-tank was unable to get their hands on the complex formula used by FIFA to seed world cup teams and were forced to construct their own system for Footy Japan cup seedings. Once the results were spat out of TMLs own equation, YCAC 2nds were considered a stronger team than YACAC 1s; and sure enough, the two leading contenders for the 08/09 TML crown were drawn to face off in the first round of the cup. The two teams had played a hard fought game in the first round of the league on a less than perfect pitch so this was a good chance to lock horns again on a large smooth pitch under lights at Hachioji.<br>The Hibs lined up with a good squad of 13, Yama busting his way out of the bedroom to  limp back on the pitch. Manager Naoki was to play for AOB in the cup and stayed on the sidelines, but fortunately Hitoshi lined up in goal. The YCAC had a full squad, with Ginger (Anthony Savage) returning from a long term knee injury, but in-from tyro Tyson was tied up in traffic and did not arrive until half time.<br>In the early exchanges Savage was pulling the strings in midfield and the YCAC dominated possession, but they were unable to find the penetration at the pointy end to create clear cut chances on goal. Tomo then went on one of his mazy runs after being released by Edu and cut a ball back to the Hibs midfielder who hit it first time, slicing it around the keeper from 15 yards for the first goal.<br>
										Ike and Hide were then bumping into each other while chasing down a ball and Hide hit the deck inside the box. Did the foul start outside the area? Did the YCAC player hit the ground too easily? Was the bumping and tangle of legs equal on both sides? The ref considered all these factors and belatedly pointed to the spot for a PK. In truth it was a close call and a decent argument could have been made for either awarding or denying it. We were surprised to see Joey T line up to take it and glad to see the ball pushed a metre beyond the Hitoshi&rsquo;s left post and the score remained at 1-0. Perhaps it was Hitoshi&rsquo;s imposing presence or maybe the infamous fluoro orange shirt or probably a combination of both that put Takeda off his game. Joe was up to his old tricks soon after, performing textbook challenges &#150; albeit under the heading How to break an opponent&rsquo;s leg. He was awarded a yellow after one particularly nasty one and was fortunate to remain on the park. His well versed knowledge of the chapter titled How to personally insult and infuriate an opponent was also on display throughout the game.<br>
										Edu was causing some havoc on the left and he got in a great position before floating in a pin-point 30 yard cross to the waiting McGirr on the back post, who got a strong header that went in off the keeper. 2-0 into half time, but we felt fortunate to be in front and knew they would come at us even harder in the second half.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										The YCAC increased the intensity in the second half and were unfortunate not to get on the scoresheet on several occasions. Hitoshi made a couple of cracking saves, one which saw the ball roll across the goal line before Ike slid in bravely at warp speed to clear, almost &lsquo;poling&rsquo; himself in the process. The YCAC&rsquo;s female striker was even causing some trouble and Tyson began to press more and more forward, creating several chances. Against the run of play Edu was the supplier again as he played in the unreal, bestest, leading scoring, rooly good, super-finest in the league Andre; who held the ball up and whacked it warp-speed at the goal from 15 yards. It hit the keeper&rsquo;s glove flush but had enough heat on it to go over the line on the bounce. McGirr almost made it four with another viciously struck shot that was on its way in before striking the tip of a defenders knee and out to safety. So it remained 3-0 until the final whistle, the same score as the league game, but in reality the match was much closer. Manager Naoki rightfully tore strips off the Hibs after the game as he was not at all happy with our second half performance. A mention to the referee DS&nbsp;who I thought had a very good game, keeping a lid on tempers and getting almost all of his decisions correct. This result leaves us still in with a shot of fulfilling our goals for the season but there is still&nbsp;plenty of hard yakka left.<br>
