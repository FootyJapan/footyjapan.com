									<br>
									Winning all of their games and barely breaking into a sweat (not because the team outclassed all the opposition (saying or even suggesting that would be bordering on outright and unnecessary arrogance), but more to do with the sub-zero conditions) <b><a class="txtlink" href="http://www.robertwalters.com" target="_blank">Robert Walters</a></b> sponsored, Footy Japan International FC claimed the winners trophy of the 4th Paul Adamson Memorial Cup, adding their name to the plaque alongside other esteemed champions, including last year's Kanto Celts FC and adding a very tall, phallic piece of silverware to the already burgeoning FJ cabinet.<br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/09/PAMT2.jpg" alt="" height="181" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">FJ International's newest recruit, British Football Academy coach Mike McKenna (also a new recruit for the British Football Club), won the MVP award and we can only assume the powers that be got it wrong in not awarding it to FJ Int. other Mike - McGirrrrrrrrrrrrr - too many Mike's and Mc's I guess... Alas, McKenna had a stellar tournament with his 'keep ball' style of football, hunger for the ball (I can still hear him screaming for the ball now from his couch in Nishi Azabu) and his rallying of the troops - well done Mike. Both of you. <br>
									<br>
									Although relatively small in size this tournament was thoroughly enjoyed by FJ Int. members (yes, of course it helps when you win) who would like to express their thanks to Saitama JETs FC organisers on the day Nate Gildart, Matt Turner et. al. and all the guys who volunteered to referee on a bitterly cold evening in Saitama.<br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/09/PAMT6.jpg" alt="" height="196" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">&quot;It would be fantastic to see this tournament being held on a scale it deserves,&quot; said a Footy Japan spokesperson. &quot;The JETS are a great bunch of lads and its a credit to the team that they honour their departed member in such a virtuous way. I hope in the future more teams will get involved and the event will become a major fixture on the annual tournament calendar for international teams in Kanto. Thank you JETS and thank you Paul.&quot;<br>
