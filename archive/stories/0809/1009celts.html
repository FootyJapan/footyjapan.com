									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 8th November.</b><br>
										FC International, top of Division 2 undefeated in 6 games, having scored 25 goals, conceding just 4 and with an impressive line up of some talented players must have thought they had a good chance of adding a first round Div 1 scalp to their repertoire.&nbsp; Celts currently mid-table in Div 1, having lost to a &ldquo;moment of magic&rdquo; in last week 0-1 defeat to Hibs were fired up to demonstrate that the talent and discipline we&rsquo;ve worked hard to build over the last two seasons is ready to start paying off some dividends. &nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/08/1108celts2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="284" align="right" border="0" hspace="5"><br>
										The game started with the usual high tempo that Celts like to play, moving the ball around the park, with Take and Peter on the wings providing Yuki &amp; Henry with a constant supply of crosses and opportunities in the opposition half however to no avail as the FC defence remained resolute to the Celts pressure, FC were as industrious and had a few forays into the Celts half with some silky skills and intricate passing which resulted in an early strike coming back off the post. &nbsp;The game continued at a rapid pace, and on 28 minutes good work from Yuki &amp; Jonesy on the left resulted in a corner. Take stepped up to kick in to the far post for Gavin to beat his marker and head in Celts opener 1-0 Celts. The game continued end to end and FC had a succession of corners wickedly whipped in by Jorge that caused moments of mayhem in the Celts box but Celts managed to clear the danger.<br>
										With 36 minutes gone, FC came through the middle of the park and a over hit ball that should have been cleared was missed kicked leaving FC&rsquo;s Ono-san to beat Aki from the edge of the box with a well placed shot to the bottom right of the Celts goal 1-1.&nbsp; Half time was a welcome rest for both teams.&nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/08/1108celts3.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="213" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">FC kicked of the 2nd half and immediately broke through the Celts midfield and looked to open the Celts defence, having reached the 18 yard box within seconds of kicking off the FC striker looked like he was about to unleash a shot until Tomo stepped in to take the ball off his foot find Yuki on the left wing, Yuki on the line still in the Celts half played a beautiful 40 yard pass across the pitch to Oli on the right, cutting open the FC midfield, Oli controlled and immediately released to the on running Henry which opened the FC defence and Henry stroked the ball into bottom left hand corner to beat the advancing Orlando. 2-1 Celts with less then 60 seconds gone in the 2nd half.&nbsp; With the lead restored Celts played counter attack football to the FC push and 10 minutes later Celts scored their 3rd with Oli getting on the end of Peter&rsquo;s cross from the right and clinically finishing the move with a shot past the keeper.&nbsp; FC continued to push forward in the hope of trying to get something out of the game and Celts just countered each attack. Celts 4th came 15 minutes later after Henry found Oli with a cross from the right for Oli to score.&nbsp; <br>
										The 4th goal seemed to kill all hope in the FC side and the 10 minutes was mainly Celts possession stroking the ball round the park and having opportunities to extend the score line but complacent finishing kept the score at 4-1. Overall Celts were deserved winners, well disciplined and solid performance from the whole team.<b><br>
