									Not even captain Alex Sahara's Dad knows what the acronym <b>NSP</b> stands for. <br>
									Nubile Sexy Players? Nice Soft and Pliable (that's a bit weird isn't in?) or Nearly Started Puberty, perhaps? One thing this writer knows however is that they came to win this tournament plain and simple and win it they did, with a convincing 2-0 win over runners up <b>BFC</b>. It was the captain himself who, having turned his marker inside out and in again, fired home for the first and <b>BFC</b>'s fate was sealed when they gave away a senseless penalty in the second half, which Eddie stuck away with conviction.<br>
									<br>
									<b>NSP</b>'s route to glory saw them dismiss last year's champions <b>YCAC</b> 2-0 in the quarters and move pass a plucky <b>Kaigun Warriors</b> team 1-0 to advance to the final.<br>

We look forward to defending our title next year,&quot; said skipper Sahara after the event, despite the fact that the legal age for drinking is 21 in Japan.<br>
									<br>
									&quot;It's great to see the young lads lift the trophy,&quot; said a Footy Japan spokesperson, &quot;they played their hearts out and at the end of the day, not only were they the best team there, they were the team who wanted it most and victory was thoroughly well-earned.&quot;<br>
									<br>
									Runners up <b>BFC</b> sent <b>Hibs</b> for early showers in the quarters thanks to 2-superb strikes from Dr. Lowes  and went on to beat <b>Variatore FC</b> in the semis by a single goal.<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/09/NY7s/NY7s5.jpg" alt="" height="255" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3"><br>
									In the Plate competition it was <b>Footy Japan International FC</b> (comprised of Footy Japan's coaching staff at the British Football Academy), who took home the silverware following a 3-0 devouring of <b>Hell Cats</b> in the final. Hell Cats themselves, a top bunch of lads including lone Westerner Peter McGill, booted out <b>BEFC</b> 1-0 in the quarters. The other semi of this competition saw <b>FJ International FC</b> dismiss an extremely plucky <b>Shane FC</b> team who had previously given   <b>FC International</b> a 3-1 reality check in the quarters, that they and the spectators certainly enjoyed. <br>
									<br>
									<br>
									In total 16-team entered this year's tournament, that due to the timing was held over a single day. <img src="../../../photos/09/NY7s/NY7s6.jpg" alt="" height="275" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">The jury's still out as to whether to hold a bigger tournament (24+ teams) over 2-days, as with the 2008 tourney or to keep it to a single day, but whatever happens in 2010, one thing is for sure, the standard will continue to improve and <b>NSP</b> will all still be far younger and fitter than you.<br>
									<br>
									<b>
									Thank you to all the referees for giving up their time on a very cold day &amp; for all the teams who made this an excellent event.</b><br>
									<br>

									We look forward to seeing you all at the next FJ Tournament which will be held at YC&amp;AC on March 20th (National Holiday).<br>
