									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 1st March.</b><br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/09/Salarex.gif" alt="" height="147" width="97" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">Like a bygone hero of old, brave 3rd Division King George went into this TML Plate match looking to kill some monstrous 1st Division opposition.&nbsp; Although Sala weren't exactly monstrous on the night, they did have big enough gnashers to crush their opponents 4-0 and spit out the pieces that were left.&nbsp;&nbsp; Raaaaargh went the Chiba Rex on Sala's club badge.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										A goal from Clarkey in the first half was the most decisive moment of the&nbsp;match, breaking King George's resistance and forcing them to attack as well as defend.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;King George began to push forward, 3 second half goals from Ryotaro, Pete and Koji finished the job&nbsp;ending King George's dreams of Plate success.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With Yusuke taking the reigns as Captain for this match there was a new look to Sala's&nbsp;attack&nbsp;with Scotty partnering Toby up front.&nbsp; These two struck up a good&nbsp;understanding early on, coming close on several occassions,&nbsp;but failing to find the killer touch&nbsp;that was needed to&nbsp;open the scoring.&nbsp; Brookey, Guido, Pete and Shige also had attempts that were denied either by the bar or the King George keeper.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With King George's keeper pulling off some great saves and their defenders using every body part to defend their goal (including their crown jewels - ouch) this&nbsp;Plate match had the look of a classic David vs Goliath battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;With half time looming it looked like King George would hold out for that all important whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										However,&nbsp;Sala's pressure finally told when Shige and&nbsp;Koji combined to work the ball into Scotty.&nbsp; His&nbsp;first time shot&nbsp;would have gone wide if it hadn't hit off a King&nbsp;George defender and fallen to Clarkey, who despatched it cooly into the&nbsp;net.&nbsp;Calmly done with&nbsp;a kawaii boshii to boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>1-0 Sala halftime</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/09/0301Pete_grylls.jpg" alt="" height="234" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">That goal before halftime proved crucial in the second half as King George&nbsp;began to chase the game.&nbsp; Wave upon wave of Sala attacks ensued as gaps appeared at the back, and it wasn't long before&nbsp;a wonderful solo goal from Ryotaro killed the tie.&nbsp; Collecting the ball with a tremendous 360* pirouette&nbsp;he totally skinned&nbsp;his marker, then danced past another defender before beating the keeper and slotting the ball&nbsp;into an empty net.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great&nbsp;stuff.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>2-0 Sala</b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The mercurial boy wonder, Ryotaro, was at it again minutes later when he diddled two more defenders, glided into the box and chipped a lovely ball to the back post which Pistol Pete Swinnerington despatched like a yard of ale at his birthday party!!!&nbsp; Sorry, that feat took him 20 minutes and 4 sittings.&nbsp; His volley for the 3rd took a split second and he only needed one bite at the cherry.&nbsp; Peachy with a nice dink as it rattled in off the&nbsp;opposite post.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>3-0 Sala</b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/09/0301sala1.jpg" alt="" height="216" width="200" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">As for the fourth, it&nbsp;was the best goal ever ever ever scored in the whole wide footballing universe beating even David Narey's audacious &quot;toe poke&quot; against Brazil in Espana '82.&nbsp; So good in fact that this roving reporter can't even remember it.&nbsp; Sorry, Koji, but I just can't......but here's that &quot;toe-poke&quot; so that you know what it was better than.<br>
