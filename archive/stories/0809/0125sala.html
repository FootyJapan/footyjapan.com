									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 25th January.</b><br>
										<br>A new captain, swearing, players returning from injury, 8 goals and a clean sheet.&nbsp; There was all this and nothing else as Sala FC outclassed YCAC 2nds in this FJ Plate match.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										First, the captaincy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monday afternoon drama series&nbsp;that Sala's captaincy had become was finally laid to rest on Sunday.&nbsp; After much hemming and hawing, Brookey decided that he was too busy and that it was time to step down and focus on his hair.&nbsp; And so, Guido &quot;The G-man&quot; Geisler returned to captain Sala once again and bring some much needed buoyancy to a close-to-sinking Sala ship.&nbsp; Otsukaresamadeshita to Brookey and&nbsp;ganbatte to Guido.<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/09/0125sala.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="166" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">
										&nbsp;<br>Next, the swearing.&nbsp; With Guido in charge a new 2009&nbsp;no-swearing policy was enforced.&nbsp; And, amazingly&nbsp;it was followed by all the Sala players.&nbsp; Once they were off the pitch though it was game on, with&nbsp;Daniel &quot;The Smut&quot; Bard coining the title of this report when he replied to&nbsp;an innocent question &quot;How about a spot of post-victory lunch&nbsp; in Yokohama's Chinatown?&quot;&nbsp; a rather unflattering response referrring to Dan's distaste for this particular area of Yokohama followed, the exact words a little to strong for print..!  Jings, what a way to mark your comeback from injury.&nbsp; And, this was not the last of Mr Bard's lewd language either, as we shall see later.&nbsp;Hmmmm.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Along with the aforementioned, Bard, Sala also welcomed back Pete &quot;P-chan&quot; Swinney, so that they lined up with a strong squad that YCAC 2 never really ooked like matching.&nbsp; Onto the&nbsp;match and the 8&nbsp;goals then.&nbsp;&nbsp; New vice-vice-captain Brookey put Sala up after a minute.&nbsp; Good play from Stu put Brookey through on goal where he finished from a tight angle.&nbsp; Brilliant stuff from Brookey who looked more like his old quality self without the pressure of the captaincy on him.&nbsp; Stu soon made it 2-0 when the keeper parried his shot only for Stu to latch onto the rebound and finish from 1 cm with some typical violence and bullying.&nbsp; Sorry, tenacity.&nbsp; Congrats to the big man for breaking his Sala duck!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/09/0125sala2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="164" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">
										At this point it was all Sala with Take proving an excellent outlet on the right.&nbsp; Great stuff as usual from him.&nbsp; The 3rd came after a corner broke to Clarkey.&nbsp; He&nbsp;held off the whole YCAC 2 team before&nbsp;cutting it back to&nbsp;Ian who&nbsp;blasted a decapitator of a shot into the back of the net from the edge of the box.&nbsp; The 4th was the best so far, with Shige picking up the ball deep in his own half and spraying a lovely through ball to Samwise who galloped onto it, took a touch, then picked his spot.&nbsp; Composed finishing from a&nbsp;man not long back from Mount Doom.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At half time Guido demanded a no mercy&nbsp;style 2nd half, much like the heartless sensei in Karate&nbsp;Kid.&nbsp; The&nbsp;troops felt momentarily bad about sweeping Daniel LaRusso's injured leg but then&nbsp;thought to hell with it and&nbsp;pumped in another 4 goals.&nbsp; Thus keeping their Cobra Kai sensei happy.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Number 5 was the pick of the day.&nbsp; A great flowing moved started with an action-starved Ian charging out of defence.&nbsp; He played the ball to Ryo who touched it off to Shiva.&nbsp; He then played a lovely weighted pass down the flank for Ian, who had continued his run, and&nbsp;showing the other side to his game Ian played it across the 6 yard box where Sam darted in near post to crash the ball into the top of the net.&nbsp; Absolute belter.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/09/0125sala3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="196" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">
										No. 6 was a penalty that Toby won then duly converted with a calm finish.&nbsp; Sala's ace striker then bagged no. 7 having been put through by Shiva whose quality passing, along with Pete's dynamic midfield play, was instrumental in continuing&nbsp;Sala's dominance.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no. 8 was an own goal, even though the scurrilous Shige tried to claim it.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										So, Sala ran out 8-0 winners.&nbsp; It must be said though&nbsp;that this cup tie could have been different had the evergreen Lenny not cleared YCAC 2's&nbsp;header&nbsp;off the line when the score was still 1-0.&nbsp; Indeed, YCAC 2 could have actually won the match by forfeit had Scotty's sideline buffoonery not been noticed by Guido, who realised instantly that Scotty had subbed on 3 players but taken off 2.&nbsp; Ooops, back to school for cadet Thomson.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Lastly, a mention for the new keeper, Shun.&nbsp; Vocal at the back, good distribution, safe hands and a clean sheet.&nbsp; Nice work, youngster.<br>
