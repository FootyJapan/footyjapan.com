								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 17th Feb.</b> YCAC 2nds progressed to the Quarter Finals of the Cup following a hard-working and disciplined performance, beating Zion 4-2 at Yokohama.&nbsp; Early in the first-half a handball led to a penalty kick and the vistors being reduced to 10 men.&nbsp;<br>
									 A red card so early in the game always seems a bit harsh, but the ref was well-positioned and clearly thought it was deliberate.&nbsp; The penalty was well converted by Gavin, buried in the bottom left hand corner.&nbsp; We then went 2-0 up following a great run into the box and and a clinical finish by Taiki.&nbsp; This seemed to fire up the Zions, who put us under consistent pressure for the next 20 minutes and really bossed the game.&nbsp; We conceded two goals in this period to go in at half-time 2-2.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									In the second half we worked very hard across the whole team and the extra man started to pay off.&nbsp; Another jinking run from Taiki into the area was ended abruptly and again the ref pointed to the penalty spot.&nbsp; Gavin converted again.&nbsp; Zion continued to push forward, which of course left gaps in their defence.&nbsp; Karl was very aware of that and at the right moment was spotted in space by Gavin who put him clean through on goal.&nbsp; Karl still had a lot to do but slotted the ball nicely past the keeper.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									In summary, a very solid team performance with the whole team working hard for each other - very impressed with our two youngest players Simon and Taiki who reallly stepped up to the challenge.<b><br>
