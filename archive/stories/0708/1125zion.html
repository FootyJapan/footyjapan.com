								<p><b>Misato, Sun 25th Nov.</b> On an picture perfect day at Misato fields on the 25th of November Zion FC faced off against The Wall Street Clash in the opening round of the F.J Cup on an unseasonably warm day that saw no clouds in the sky and temperatures sitting comfortably in the early 20's. The hot and cold Zion FC were looking to put the agony of their previous 6-0 drubbing from JETRO FC in their last league match behind them as they faced up against another team struggling to find consistency, The Wall Street Clash. Despite the fact that in their most recent meeting in the league Zion had run out convincing winners 4-0 over Wall street back in early September the pressure was certainly on to perform as Zion continue to slowly slide from the top of the TML leader board. Both teams were pumped for a big one as they lined up. The 1st half was a very hard fought affair with both teams having several opportunities. But it was last season's top goal scorer Nixon Benjie Dasilva who opened Zion's account with his 1st goal after solid build up from defence all the way through mid-field giving him great service. It wasn't long before Benjie, who was in a dangerous mood today, was in again after collecting a pass from Ken to score again. At half time it was 2-0.<br>
									The second half saw Wall Street begin with renewed vigor, really trying to claw their way back into the contest. However, just a few minutes in, a great early goal by Ken who knocked it in off a precision corner from Ichiro spelled the beginning of the end for Wall Street who were now 3-0 down. From there Zion went on with the job comprehensively with Benjie not only going on to get his hat trick but in the end finishing with 4 goals to his name. Defender Watanabe also added to the carnage with a goal of his own. The final score was 6-0, a fitting way to erase the agony of several weeks before when Zion had been on the recieving end of an identical result. Strong games were had by all. The game was won from the back with the defensive line of Phill, Yanagi, Charles &amp; Watanabe being flawless with desperate big tackles that really rattled a Wall Street attack who were no slouches. Now the up and down Zion F.C are hoping that they can take their dazzling Cup form into the TML and revive their sagging League fortunes. If they can produce some of the brilliant play that they are capable of, a return to the top of the TML ladder is imminent..<b><br>
