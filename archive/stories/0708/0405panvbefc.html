								<p><b>Misato, Sun 5th April.</b><br>
									The wind and tumbleweed blew around on a typically blustery day out at Misato where the 3rd division Panthers faced BEFC. Looking around at the beginning of the match we were daunted at the prospect of playing a division 1 team without having any subs on the bench! Still we came out the trap well, passing the ball around in a manner that was distinctly un-panthers like!! Just to make sure we weren&rsquo;t turning into Arsenal, the defense hoofed and hoped to get the ball out of the danger area on more than one occasion. <br>
									One said hoof and hope came from yours truly, straight down the middle of the pitch to our waiting striker Kev, who took the opportunity to put us one ahead. Obviously this was very odd, 1 up in the first half and passing the ball, maybe our illustrious leader was making some headway! We continued the pressure in to the second half where after some discussion Yusuke took Nick&rsquo;s place up front to score the second in spectacular fashion under pressure from all sides. It was all too good to be true though as our legs got heavier BEFC seemed to pick up the pace and score two successive goals through the knackered defense. A straight red card sent off our striker for a fairly innocuous arm incident which left the team a little demoralised. We fought on and ended the game with a huge amount of cramp and a 2 all draw. Straight to the penalties!! The nerves got to both of the first takers with both teams missing the first shot. It was head to head for the next 3 Panthers shots until a placed shot from BEFC rolled wide, we had our chance and Yusuke calmly took us to the final of the plate!<b><br>
