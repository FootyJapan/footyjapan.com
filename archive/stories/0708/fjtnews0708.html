															The final finally arrived after a few changes and postponements, we had got there. Not bad for our first season!<br>
															We all arrived, uncharacteristically, early at the station, eager to play the final of the Plate. We were so early that the other team didn&rsquo;t turn up for another 2 hours!<br>
															<br>
															Thinking that we had won without even playing we got down to using the lovely pitch at Hachioji park and set out a 9 aside game for fun. The opposing team turned up with 8 players and we decided to get started. <a class="txtlink" href="0607FJplate.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

															As double bids go, BFC's attempt to add the Footy Japan Cup to their TML title went very badly, ending in a 5-0 humping by Tokyo Hibernian.<br>
															<br>
															Without taking away from a deserved Hibs win, only a brilliantly taken third goal was truly worthy of a final between the TML's top two teams. <a class="txtlink" href="0601FJfinal.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

															No less than twenty League places and 3 Divisions separate these two teams, and for long periods of this semifinal you'd have to say that it looked like it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the end of the game only a single controversial goal settled affairs in favour of the 1st Division side and so a very fine cup run for YCAC2nds finally came to an end. <a class="txtlink" href="0426ycac.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

															Two goals from Keisuke propelled BFC to a 3-1 win over Sala, sending them into the Footy Japan Cup final and keeping them on course for the double.<br>
															<br>
															BFC even spotted Sala a head-start, courtesy of some batty defending. As sweet a corner as it was from the right, Toby Long could have brewed a cup of Earl Grey and cracked open the Garibaldis such was the time he was afforded to head Sala in front, albeit somewhat against the run of play. <a class="txtlink" href="0426bfc.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

															A generous cloud of dust, 1000 bobbles,&nbsp;5 yellow cards,&nbsp;two moments of skill,&nbsp;one&nbsp;ludicrous goal, a mental linesman and a patridge in a pear tree.

															BFC vs. the Swiss in the quarterfinals&nbsp; of the Cup&nbsp;, a quality match up of the top of the league side vs. a potent (yet inconsistent) Swiss side.&nbsp; The result was was an intense game with numerous chances but solid defending and goal keeping meant a lone mistake would cost the match. &nbsp;The lineups at the start were a bit of a surprise with the BFC missing their captain Jon, big Al, and Shosuke yet their replacements were some awfully young players from Carlos' stable in&nbsp;&nbsp;Chofu&nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the game started you saw little drop in quality and the&nbsp;&nbsp;youngsters'&nbsp;speed was&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;an&nbsp; advantage. <a class="txtlink" href="0404bfcvswiss.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

															After a full day of rain on the Friday the omens were not looking good for this 2nd Round cup game against the Celts which had already had 2 previous cancellations once due to snow and the other due to gale force winds. Late on Friday night the message went out the game was almost certainly going to be cancelled (96.7% chance of cancellation read the skippers e-mail) - some took this as a green light to get on it in a big way - others reasoned that the 3.3% chance of it being on was enough of a possibility that the slippers should stay firmly on. How right the optimists were, because Saturday morning came around and it was warm, bright and wonderfully sunny - it was game on at the third time of asking.&nbsp; <a class="txtlink" href="0315bfcvcelts.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>
