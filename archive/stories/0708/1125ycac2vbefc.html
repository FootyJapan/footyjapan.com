								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 25th Nov.</b> It's interesting how the odd result can have a big impact on&nbsp;promotion and relegation issues.&nbsp; The last time these 2 teams&nbsp;played each other&nbsp;was last season in TML Div. 2, when the BEFC ran out 2-1 winners in a close game and of course went on to win promotion&nbsp;to Division 1.&nbsp; YCAC2 meanwhile didn't make the cut last season and ended up in the new Division 3.&nbsp; So although on paper this&nbsp;was a Division 1 versus Division 3 cup fixture, we were reasonably&nbsp;confident of giving a good account of ourselves.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The first 20 minutes belonged to the YCAC, where we played good football and caused the BEFC defence a number of problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidence was boosted early on by a great strike from Matt Tuck.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards Alex Goldie was unlucky not to score, his effort rebounding off the post straight to Gavin Margetson who made no mistake from 10 yards.&nbsp; So 2-0 ahead and an upset looked likely.&nbsp; Unfortunately the next 40 minutes were largely bossed&nbsp;by BEFC, who scored 2 goals either side of half-time to be leading 4-2 on the hour.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									In truth they were good value for the lead, but credit to our lads who never gave up on the game.&nbsp; Paul Wood it was who really took the initiative, starting to push forward and gambling with&nbsp;3 at the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the extra man played dividends as&nbsp;Paul found himself in the BEFC area&nbsp;and hit a sweet first-time shot into the net.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God knows what Paul was thinking, putting his membership of the&nbsp; Union of Centre Halves (&quot;OUCH&quot;) at risk by flagrantly wandering into the opposition area during open play.&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of reckless play&nbsp;visibly&nbsp;lifted the YCAC, whilst at the same time BEFC were starting to look jittery - as you might, if being bothered by centre halves who are not following the&nbsp;rulebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we get the equaliser - well actually yes, with only a few mintes left, Gavin found his way into the area, a neat turn and a great shot at the near post&nbsp;and bringing us level at 4-4.&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn't&nbsp;time left for either team to&nbsp;do much else and so penalties beckoned.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Our goalkeeper this season,&nbsp;Harty, is a fine shot-stopper and an imposing figure (i.e. bigger than me)&nbsp;between the posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;He saved 3 of 5 BEFC penalties&nbsp;which was a fantastic effort.&nbsp; YCAC penalty takers were Gavin, Phil Denham, Alex and Matt, and all bar Matt converted (but we'll let him off, it was well-saved).&nbsp;&nbsp;So that was enough for us to run out 3-2 winners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Another really good effort across the whole squad with all the team contributing.&nbsp; If I had to single anybody out in addiiton to those already mentioned,&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;Taiki Rasmussen&nbsp;had a fantastic&nbsp;first half for YCAC on the right wing, really caused no end of problems.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Thanks to BEFC for a&nbsp;good game and as usual well ref'd by Paul.<b><br>
