Fantasista at Yoyogi Park on Saturday. <br>
									<br>
									Not even the all day trance party going on next to the ground could help either team really get their groove on during a first half of relative domination from W.A.S. W.A.S fielded 3 debutants for this match and the early stages of the first half saw some nice passing from both sides but with little thrust. First time paring of Hino and Cordier up front for the W.A.S showed some good potential for a little and large partnership, but the final shots were either high and wide or straight at the keeper. Fantasista were limited to a couple of long range efforts as W.A.S looked the more likely to make the breakthrough. <img src="../../../photos/07/1208was3.jpg" alt="" height="213" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">The industrious Mako was causing problems for the Fantasista right back as W.A.S often attempted to attack down the left. Fantasista almost took what would have been a shock lead when they managed to get a shot in on goal that clipped the bar. Xavi went close with a free kick for W.A.S before a nice through ball from Hino put Cordier through and although the finish wasn&rsquo;t the truest, he made no mistake and found the bottom corner. This goal seemed to boost the confidence of W.A.S as they looked to grab another before the break. Mako&rsquo;s powerful run and shot was parried to Cordier who contrived to blast the rebound into the side netting.  One nil to W.A.S at half time but it could have been more. <br>
									<br>

Fantasista had obviously been on the genki drinks at half time, as they kicked off and equalized 29 seconds into the second half. According to the ref, this could be a FJ Cup record. The Fantasista left winger did well to burst into the box and fire a stinging toe-punt into the top corner. Game on. Buoyed by this great start to the second half Fantasista poured forward and started to dominate possession. This seemed to suit W.A.S for a while as they were content to play on the counter-attack with the ever lively Hino showing some nice touches but he may not have had his shooting boots on because everything was straight at the keeper. Fantasista continued to put the pressure on and took the lead mid-way into the second half. Debutant keeper for W.A.S won&rsquo;t enjoy seeing the replays as he managed to punch the corner into his own net from a corner delivered right under the crossbar. The game ebbed and flowed with Mako somehow heading a rebound over when it might have been easier to score for W.A.S. This miss proved to be crucial as Fantasiata effectively sealed the match moments later when after confusion down the W.A.S right side the Fantasista forwards were let in for an easy finish. W.A.S huffed and puffed in search for an equalizer with the Fantasista keeper pulling off a few decent saves towards the end of the match. In the end it wasn&rsquo;t to be for W.A.S, but overall it was decent match played in a good spirit. All the best to FC Fantasista in the next round and the W.A.S will have to settle for an attempt at the Plate.<b><br>
