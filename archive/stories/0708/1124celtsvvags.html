								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sat 24th Nov.</b> 3.00 Saturday afternoon, sun shining, grass pitch, cup football where even the losers are guaranteed another crack at qualifying for the 2nd round. Does it get better than this? In the commercially greedy TML where fixtures are arranged for prime time viewing in Misato usually Sunday bright and early this was a rare opportunity to enjoy football at the traditional kick off. <br>
									<br>
									Both teams seemed relaxed and looking to play football from the start. From a Celts point of view it was nice to get back some of our more attacking players after missing 8 players for the previous league game against Sala.<br>
									<br>
									Vagabonds also came with healthy numbers and started brightly. Their central midfielder was comfortable in possession and started to get a foothold on the game. With two pacey, skilful young strikers up front, Vagabonds always had a decent outlet. But as the game continued, Celts started to get a passing game going and a nice passage of interplay released Henry and he finished confidently past the keeper with 25 minutes on the clock. Shortly later, we managed to get a second goal from the same source. This time a deep cross from Toru was met by Henry's head. Going in two nil at half time was a rare but nice feeling but we knew well this game wasn't over.<br>
									<br>
									The first 15 minutes of the second half saw Celts probably play their best football with surging runs from Jonesy all over the pitch, more Jonah Lomu than Ronaldo. One such run resulted in a free kick which Toru floated over and Mel rose to head it nicely across the keeper. At 3-0 this game should have been wrapped up but Vagabonds to their credit never gave up. Another Celts attack looked to have resulted in a clear penalty but the ref rejected appeals and as soon as you could say 'the referee's a wa......'he had given a penalty at the other end Vagabonds. In fairness it was a penalty and was well converted but the first non-decision could have changed the outcome of the game. Henry then managed to put more than a smile on everyone's face with outrageous skill where he stopped Vince's shot on the line. He added to his litany of showboating when a simple pass to Vince looked on to make it 4 but played it straight into the keeper. I suppose though 2 goals from a man who realized we were not at Misato 10 mins into the game this was a positive return.<br>
									<br>
									Vagabonds  continued pressing and were rewarded with a bullet header from a corner. Lucky the net was there or else some of the old dears playing lawn bowls could have been severely interrupted. Celts managed to hold out for the last few minutes in an entertaining fairly played cup game. All to play for again in the league back at the regular Sunday morning time in the Misato dustbowl..<b><br>
