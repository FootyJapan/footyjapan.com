								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 24th February.</b> <br>
									Sala, not for the first time, complained that the Saitama Jets are dirty and based on the evidence after the game they were correct &#150; only one Jets player took a shower, compared to most of the Sala squad.  If the comment was referring to events on the pitch however, the evidence is hardly convincing; there were not an especially high number of free kicks, no cards of any description and with all players shaking hands and walking, rather than limping or being stretchered, off the pitch, then it&rsquo;s a tough accusation to make stick.  Competitive, committed and physical?  Absolutely.  That&rsquo;s how the game&rsquo;s played and if you can&rsquo;t handle physical contact then you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be out there in the first place.<br>
									<br>
									The game itself was entertaining enough and although periodically very windy, the gusts did not affect the game as much as one may have expected.  Sala are good side and play a nice passing game, whilst the Jets are more technically limited and so like to get tackles in and play a fast direct style that can unsettle opponents, but also requires levels of stamina that most of the team do not possess.  As a result Sala had periods of possession in which they knocked the ball around well, whilst the Jets sat back building up for their next head of steam.<br>
									<br>
									Sala opened the scoring midway through the first half, as the Jets midfield and defence were slow to react to a loose ball and their striker got clear, nudged it around the Jets&rsquo; giant Kiwi goalkeeper and finished clinically from an ever-reducing angle. 1-0 Sala.  It was no more than they deserved as they had been looking the more likely for some time.<br>
									<br>
									The Jets roused themselves and not long after Hayshi went close with a powerful run and rising shot that just cleared the Sala crossbar.  Next Suyama&rsquo;s ball over the top was not dealt with at all well by the Sala defence, Kikuchi broke through and made no mistake in lobbing Sid from 30 yards. 1-1. The rest of the half was scrappy as things became more competitive and the teams went in level at the half.<br>
									<br>
									Sala started the second half very well and had the Jets pressed back in their own half for the first 15 minutes.  If things had continued this way then the Jets would have been entitled to ask for a 50% refund on the match fee, as only half of the pitch was in use.  After about 15 minutes of constant pressure, during which Kingsbeer was called upon to make a couple of very good saves, the inevitable Sala goal was scored from a free kick.  It was scrappy and a tad fortunate, but no more than was deserved. 2-1 Sala.<br>
									<br>
									From here things changed, whether Sala stopped playing, or the Jets started, is hard to say, a bit of both probably, but the game opened up and the Jets started making in-roads into the Sala defence.  Loren, growing more into his wide-left attacking role with every game, was by far the Jets&rsquo; best player on the day and at times seemed to be playing Sala on his own.  Constantly available to receive the ball, he kept the Sala right-back well occupied with his pace and power and on occasions it took two or three white shirts to stop him.  Not content with merely attacking, he consistently chased back to support the midfield and defence, winning the ball and starting attacks from deep.  The Jets pressed and created a few openings, but were unable to get any shots on target.  Hayashi made a number of lung-busting runs from right back and Kikuchi and Loren linked up well, with Loren a whisker away from converting a driven diagonal ball at the back post.  You could gauge the Sala defence&rsquo;s discomfort from the length of time it was taking Sid to collect the ball for his goal kicks, he might be getting on but I&rsquo;ve seen more rapid movement from folks on Zimmer Frames.<br>
									 <br>
									As the Jets poured forward it left gaps in the centre of midfield and down the flanks which Sala needed little invitation to exploit and the Jets were probably more likely to concede a third than they were to score an equalizer.  But there were to be no more goals and the referee, who was excellent throughout, brought an enjoyable game to a close and a deserved 2-1 victory for Sala.  The Jets&rsquo; attention will now turn to their exciting relegation battle and will hope to field full strength teams for their final six games (sudden changes to the fixture list notwithstanding) to give themselves a fighting chance of staying up.<b><br>
