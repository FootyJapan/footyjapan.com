									Torrential rain was responsible for the postponement of this tournament from its scheduled date of March 20th and mother nature nearly dealt Kanto's amateur international football community, the benefactors behind the event and <b>UNICEF</b>, the recipients, another blow by once again allowing the heavens to open up. <br>
									Thankfully, she held back just enough for the event to go ahead as planned and a little bit of sand to soak up the puddles saw the tournament kick of with 20-teams vying for silverware.<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/08/C6s/08c6-8.jpg" alt="" height="178" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3"><br>
									<br>
									Last year's winners FC International, along with YCAC, Azule FC, a strong looking Lions outfit, Robert Walters and BFC Reuters, all showed early signs of promise, but at the end of the group stages it was FC International, Team Italia, Lions FC and Kanto Celts who toped their groups, with BFC Reuters, Azule FC, Shane FC and YC&amp;AC 2nds also going through to the knockout stages of the cup competition.<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/08/C6s/08c6-5.jpg" alt="" height="174" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">Having systematically disposed of BFC Reuters 2-0 in the quarter finals, Team Italia went on to face Azule FC (winners of the tournament in 2006), only to see their hopes dashed by a physical Japanese team (boasting a few ex pros), who are all  familiar with the small-side game and made easy work of burying their Italian counterparts with neat two-touch football and clinical finishing to secure their place in the finals, having also beaten FC International on penalties in the quarter finals.<br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/08/C6s/08c6-6.jpg" alt="" height="228" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">Shane FC were out-gunned by a tenacious Lions performance in the quarter finals, as were YC&amp;AC 2nds by a Celts team who, having only turned up with 3-players to begin with, were coming into their own game-by-game, highlighted by their comprehensive 2-0 victory over Lions FC in the semi finals.<br>
									<br>
									So to the finals and it has to be said that in the 4-year history of this tournament this was one of the most exciting, exhilarating and best-supported finals this competition has ever seen. Never before have their been so many spectators in the stands for the final game (despite the miserable conditions) which saw two teams of equal strength physically go head to head. <br>
									<img src="../../../photos/08/C6s/08c6-2.jpg" alt="" height="202" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">In terms of technical football smart money may have been on Azule FC, that said in terms of determination, the will to win, team spirit and some inspiring individual performances in the run up to this game, you'd be forgiven for having a flutter on the Celts - in fact you'd be more than forgiven - you'd win. <br>
									<br>
									Stalwart defending by both teams and some impressive saves at each end by the keepers, of which Azule's was a stand-in due to their regular keeping having to miss the final due to receiving two yellow cards prior to this game, kept the crowd on edge and their decibels rising (in favor of the Celts it has to be said). <br>
									<img src="../../../photos/08/C6s/08c6-10.jpg" alt="" height="206" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">Azule played a short game from the back, attacking through midfield with gusto, speed and skill. Celts opted to play a longer game, hitting their target man Henry Monohan, who was proving to be more than a handful for his marker (and everyone else who tried to mark him in the tournament). At the final whistle it was a well-deserved Celts team who claimed the cup, with a 2-1 win over a very resilient opposition. Celts striker Henry Monohan was also unanimously voted the tournaments MVP and was presented with the Magellan MVP award for his outstanding footballing performance on the pitch throughout the day. <br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../photos/08/C6s/08c6-11.jpg" alt="" height="173" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">In the plate final an outstanding performance by the Robert Walters team, who narrowly missed qualifying for the cup knockout stages  by number of goals scored (ironically they conceded less goals than any other team in their group), against a quality France FC team comprised of power, flair &amp; finesse, not to mention Captain Jack Sparrow in goal, saw them emerge victors with an outstanding Golden Goal by new recruit (pun intended) Roman Barua - ending the game 2-1 in extra time.<br>
									<br>

Footy Japan &amp; the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club would like to sincerely thank the generous support provided by all the event's sponsors, all the teams (see below) who were enthusiastic and sporting throughout the day, even though conditions were less than ideal and the officials, some of who volunteered their services on the day to help out.<br>
									<br>
									When Kanto's amateur international football community and corporate Japan unite - we can, as we've proved over the last 4-years, truly help make a difference.<br>
									<br>
									Thank you everyone.<br>
