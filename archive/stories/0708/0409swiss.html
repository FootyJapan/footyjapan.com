								<p><b>Tokyo, Wed 9th April.</b><br>
									Having beaten BFC 2-1 in the FJ cup quarter finals on Saturday, April 5th at Oi Futo, the Swiss were forced to relinquish their semi-final spot to their British adversaries due to one of their players having played for another team in the same competition - in strict contravention of the tournaments rules: <a class="txtlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/pages/fjcup_reg.html" target="_blank">HERE</a><br>
									<br>
									FJ Competitions personnel, responsible for tracking &amp; updating match statistics came across the infringement and quite rightly informed the tournament organizer, who, having sought counsel from senior referees, other amateur and professional competitions run in a similar manner, ruled that a forfeit win be given to BFC for gross infringement of the tournament's rules. <br>
									<br>
									&quot;It's no way to win a game of football,&quot; said BFC's captain Jon Day. &quot;Especially seeing as the better team won on the day, but I guess if the rules are bent, or overlooked in one instance, it doesn't set a very good precedent for the future. I feel for the Swiss as our two teams have a long and healthy history - I hope this won't affect this too much.&quot;<br>
									<br>
									The official word from Footy Japan KK was: <br>
									<br>
									&quot;This wasn't a nice decision to have to make, but the rules are there for a reason. We hope this sends a message to all the teams playing in any Footy Japan organized football, that the captains especially &amp; their players as well should be aware of the rules of the competition and follow them to the letter, or risk being sanctioned. Ignorance will never be an excuse&quot;<b><br>
