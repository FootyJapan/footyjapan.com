											Jorge 'the Mexican Maestro' Kuriyama scored twice leading <b>FC International</b>  to a 3-0 win over <b>YC&amp;AC</b> in this years New years 7's final. He then picked up the cup at the award ceremony and nobody has seen either since. Well we've come to expect such things from the flamboyant Latino and I don't think his team will mind after his well placed header set <b>FC International</b> up for their first ever Footy Japan 7's title.<br>
										<br>

									Last Years Champions <b>NSP</b> once again looked very good for going all the way during their group matches, beating <b>Hibs</b>, <b>Sala</b> and <b>Swiss kickers</b> with some grreat football from their young players but they came unstuck in the 1/4 Finals vs <b>IFG Panthers</b>. The Division 2 leaders held the young <b>NSP</b> boys at bay with a well organized, if slightly defensive strategy. After a 0-0 draw, Panthers pounced in the PK shootout winning 6-5 sending the kids home for an early bath.<br>
										<br>
											In the semi-finals, <b>Panthers</b> tried the same tactics against <b>FC Internationa</b>l, who'd fought off <b>RW Clash</b> 2-0 in the previous match,  and things were looking like they'd go to PKs once again. Both keepers had done well to keep the match scoreless but <b>FC International's</b> constant pressure paid off a minute from time when they poked in a parried shot to go into the finals.<br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0103ny7s4.jpg" alt="" height="175" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">
									On the other side of the knockout rounds, <b>King George</b> were slain by the fiery <b>Hellcats</b> in the quarter-finals and <b>YC&amp;AC</b> sent <b>Hibs</b> home. It was <b>YC&amp;AC</b> who made it through to the Finals though with a 2-0 win over the <b>cats</b> in a hard fought contest.<br>
										<br>
											So, two of TML Division 1's top strikers faced off in the finals, Sukui Ono and Hide Yoshioka, who only last year had been strike partners in <b>FC international</b>'s domination of Division 2.  <br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0103ny7s5.jpg" alt="" height="168" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">It was Inter's El Capitano, Jorge who garnered the honors in this match however, scoring twice to Ono's once in their 3-0 victory, starting with a well placed header in at the far post. The YC&amp;AC team, made up of many of their younger members, battled hard trying to gain a foothold but to no avail. With men being pushed forward looking for the equalizer, <b>FC International</b> hit on the break and could have scored a couple more if not for the heroics of young (16) Zack in goal. A well deserved Victory for the team from Roppongi, finishing the tournament with a record of 16 goals for and only 1 against.<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0103ny7s6.jpg" alt="" height="214" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3"><br>
											In the Plate final it was <b>Sala FC</b> who faced off with <b>Swiss Kickers</b>. Neither team has been doing too well in the league this season, so it was good to see them having the chance to get some silverware in the cabinet. A single goal by <b>Sala</b> debutant Selwyn Walsh was enough to seal the win for the Chiba boys in a very tight match and give them their first trophy since winning the plate in the <b>FJ Cup</b> competition last season.<br>
										<br>
										So another 7's tournament completed on a beautiful sunny winters day. It was great to see all of the matches played in very good spirits and not a single yellow card needed to be shown. Schedules ran on time and nobody had to wait around for long periods, a great days football for all!<br>
