									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 17th January.</b><br>
										<br>
										Having walked away from YCAC with a&nbsp;deserved point against the first team&nbsp;last week, BFC went into this fixture expecting&nbsp;a win, and that despite around 10 players being unavailable or cup tied with Vags. As it was, two late pull-outs saw BFC travel with&nbsp;only 11 players, which&nbsp;was nearly 10 at half time when Saco revealed he'd been playing the last few minutes of the half with a golf ball in his sock, apparently sown into his ankle - all very odd, Saco played on (and well), mostly heading his way through the second half.<br>
										The&nbsp;first half&nbsp;was&nbsp;quite pedestrian with Carlos and Sho setting the scene early doors: Carlos, all refreshed from&nbsp;his&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;break misbehaving in Paraguay,&nbsp;sees Sho,&nbsp;all just-been-to-Fiji-twinkle-in-his-eye&nbsp;and&nbsp;almost touching up the last man, and bang, 40 yard inch perfect ball over the top for Sho to run onto and calmly slot home. 5 minutes gone, 1-0 BFC. There should have been more BFC goals after that with Jon, Hamish and Sho all mixing it up well and having chances saved by the YCAC keeper (he was the best player on the park on the day) but it took a moment of Sho magic to put some distance between the sides as&nbsp;he picked up a loose ball in the YCAC box and danced and dummied his way around 3 or 4 players before slotting home.<br>
										<br>
										<b> 2-0 BFC. Half Time.</b><br>
										<br>
										The second half passed much as the first: BFC with plenty of possession, YCAC looking to counter through Neil, Karl and Satoshi but with BFC's Taichi, Shota and Carlos dictating the pace of the game in the midfield. Plenty of chances were created for the BFC boys up front with the YCAC keeper making some&nbsp;good saves. Jon Day then bagged a classy header to make it 3-0 and then another to make it 4, while Karl came close at the other end with a typical powerful strike from distance - only the woodwork kept him out.<br>
										With time running out, BFC continued to push forward and with a minute or so left on the clock the tireless Taka Imai smashed home from distance - a&nbsp;great strike from surely TML's best left sided player, 5-0 BFC. And that was that, BFC&nbsp;cruise into the next round but more importantly look to be picking up momentum as they move into a run of 3 crucial league games in the next 3 weeks.<br>
