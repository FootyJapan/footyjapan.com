											BFC scrambled their way past competitive opposition to top group C while YCAC strolled comfortably past their contemporaries in group D to both move into the semi finals. <br>
											Celts sparked off the evening with a 3 - 0 drubbing over FC Dinos on pitch B. The sizable squad aiding recovery on what was a very warm and humid evening. A far tighter match could be seen on pitch A as group seed BFC took on FC International with FC Int taking early control of the affair.&nbsp; <b><a class="txtlink" href="0815Summer7s.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											It was Hibs and YCFC who battled humid conditions to wrap up their group qualifying in style to move onto the finals on August 22nd.<br>
											&nbsp;Baking conditions were pleasantly alleviated by a cooling bay breeze that couldn't have been timed better as 6 teams convened at YCAC for the first of 2 group stages yesterday evening.&nbsp;<br>
											<br>
											The ever present and courageous boys from Shane FC braved the Hanabi packed trains on their mission from Saitama, as did the Tokyo based teams Hibs, Sarugaku FC and Swiss.&nbsp; <b><a class="txtlink" href="0801Summer7s.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											Goals from Andre Pinto (2), Yohei Ohta and Tomomitsu Kunii secured a 4-1 victory for Tokyo Hibernian over arch rivals British FC and a league and cup double. It's also back to back FJ Cup titles for the Hibs who've been crowned league &amp; Cup champions on 3 occasions now in the seven years since the start of TML. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0606FJCupfinal.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											It was a nice season for the Swiss: A sweet winning streak that brought promotion to Division 1, good performances in the New Year's and Charity 7's and a great turnout of players for the games. The plate would be the icing on the cake: Not the most prestigious title, but a title nonetheless.<br>
											<br>
											The opposition in the final were the Jet 2nds, a team that is still in the run for promotion to the second division and looked like a stronger oppostion than their first team in the semi-final. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0522platefinal.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

										<p><b>Hachioji Park, May 8th, 2009</b>.<br>
											BFC wobbled but they didn't fall down. A soft penalty perhaps evening out Sala's lucky equaliser, BFC ground out a 4-2 win to reach the Cup final which they will want to play on a grown-up's pitch this time please!<br>
											Little if anything can, or should, be noted about a first half which will be rued as 40 minutes (two hours if you include train into the country, changing, warm-up etc.) we will never get back. Both sides were very poor, let's leave it at that. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0508bfc.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

										<p><b>YCAC, April 29, 2009</b>.<br>
											No I am not mistaken and that is not the wrong date. That was the date when Hibs got smashed by YCAC on their pitch last year, my only loss to them during my four years wearing the green uniform and perhaps the most painful one of all. Unfortunately, I do not have a time machine like my friend Marty McFly &quot;In Back to The Future,&quot; to go back in time and bring us back last year's title. So Hibs had to first face their ghosts from the past, then rebuild a better team and hopefully after all that get another shot at the title. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0425hibs.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											As dawn broke, memories of hail, wind, rain and solemn faces quickly disappeared from the minds of all 2009 Charity tournament veterans.&nbsp; Instead, the tingly sensation we felt as a child on birthday morn as the sun poked through our curtains &#150; confirming our hopes for a bright and sunny day to host our back yard birthday party were re-ignited within all of this year&rsquo;s Charity 7&rsquo;s fully grown participants.&nbsp; It was going to be a party alright, a fun packed football frenzy in Yamate complete with thrills, spills, skills, goals and gaffs, not to mention a small dose of controversy plus a side sprinkle of tom foolery.&nbsp; All in the name of 2 worthy causes, this year&rsquo;s tournament beneficiaries <a class="txtlink" href="http://www.refugeesinternationaljapan.org/user/home.php" target="_blank"><b>Refugees International Japan</b></a> and for the second year running &#150; <b><a class="txtlink" href="http://www.jbcfoundation.com" target="_blank">Jeannine and Billy's Children's Foundation</a></b> in Cambodia. <b><a class="txtlink" href="charity7s.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											With 17 goals in their two previous meetings this quarter final meeting of FCI and BFC was always going to an exciting game. Unfortunately for FCI a late arrival meant they took to the pitch without a warm-up and for that they were punished. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0328bfc.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											Inspired by the boys of &rsquo;66, YC&amp;AC &lsquo;X&rsquo; were crowned 2010 Footy Japan Charity 7&rsquo;s champions as Anthony Savage led his team to victory in a tournament which was quite simply a fantastic advert for the game.<br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											Kitted out the same as Sir Alf&rsquo;s world cup winners were 44 years ago, they managed to navigate their way through the group stages without too much fuss, two victories and a draw seeing them top the group and move safely through to the knockout stages. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0322ycac.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											Who would have thought that such a motley crew of briggands, rapscallions and shysters (plus the Vagabonds) could have served up an 8 goal thriller?&nbsp; Not me, that's for sure. But lo and behold this cup classic ended 5-3&nbsp;to Sala&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Vagabonds putting up a great fight.<br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											2 goals from man of the match, Pete Swinney, and a goal each from Shige, Lenny and Ryotaro earned Sala their place in the last 16 of the cup.. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0117sala.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											&#x2026;......but seriously,<br>
											This was a game we were all looking forward to.&nbsp; A real test to see how far we've come and, if we can secure promotion, how we might fair next year alongside the big boys.&nbsp; Yeah, big boys.&nbsp; That was the first thing that struck me on arriving at Fukuda Denshi to see the opposition warming up.&nbsp; I don't know if it's the Celtic hoops that just make players look bigger, or what.&nbsp; Still, not to be out-done in the pre-match psychological warfare, we changed into a fetching little pink number, which must have struck fear into the hearts of the Celts players.&nbsp; Errr, remind me again, who's idea was the pink kit?. <b><a class="txtlink" href="0109pants.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

											Sala FC defeated the Swiss Kickers to take the plate trophy while last years champions NSP were knocked out on penalties very early on.<br>
											Three teams had to be turned away in the week leading up to the tournament as a full complement of 16 teams turned out on a beautiful, sunny January morning to do battle in Footy Japan's latest 7 a side tournament, showing how popular these events are becoming. <b><a class="txtlink" href="newyear7s.html">more</a></b><br>

											YC&amp;AC played groggy throughout the game, but managed to get up 1-0 after 20 minutes when linkman Tim Miller headed a beautiful cross from Satoshi Mitsuda, and 2-0 after an individual effort inside the box by Shigehiro Yamazaki in the 25th minute.<br>
											BEFC came out aggressively in the 2nd half through the build up of Takanori Nakayama but lack of precision in the final third left them away of reach from a goal in the YC&amp;AC net. YC&amp;AC will host the Saitama Jets next<br>
