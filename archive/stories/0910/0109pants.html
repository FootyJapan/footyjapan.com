										<br>
										&#x2026;......but seriously,<br>
										This was a game we were all looking forward to.&nbsp; A real test to see how far we've come and, if we can secure promotion, how we might fair next year alongside the big boys.&nbsp; Yeah, big boys.&nbsp; That was the first thing that struck me on arriving at Fukuda Denshi to see the opposition warming up.&nbsp; I don't know if it's the Celtic hoops that just make players look bigger, or what.&nbsp; Still, not to be out-done in the pre-match psychological warfare, we changed into a fetching little pink number, which must have struck fear into the hearts of the Celts players.&nbsp; Errr, remind me again, who's idea was the pink kit?<br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0109pants1.jpg" alt="" height="195" width="200" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Anyway, the teams lined up in glorious sunshine and perfect playing conditions, Panthers playing 3-5-2 with plenty of width against a well organised Celts side.&nbsp; It's difficult to put your finger on the Celts formation as Henry seems to be playing 3 different positions all at the same time!&nbsp; Both teams seemed to be giving the opposition plenty of respect and sitting quite deep so a fairly cagey opening with few chances at either end.&nbsp; Panthers had the first real opening with a free kick about 25 yards out.&nbsp; Kei hit a superb strike which crashed off the bar with the keeper beaten.&nbsp; At the other end, Celts were beginning to push forward into wide positions and 2 or 3 dangerous crosses were starting to spell trouble.&nbsp; So it proved mid-way through the first half when a ball into the box was only half cleared and when it was crossed back into the far post, Pete McGill headed back across the 6 yard box for Henry to power his header past a dispairing Sid.&nbsp; 1-0 Celts.&nbsp; Not much goal mouth action followed in the first half with Matt keeping the Panther's defence on their toes and a strong Celts defence keeping a firm grip on Sho and Ma up front. &nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0109pants3.jpg" alt="" height="196" width="473" align="left" border="0" hspace="5"><br>
										Second half saw a couple of changes with Tom adding a bit of height and strength up front and Phil Greene coming on for the old guy at left back. &nbsp; With Romen and Jay doing the holding job and Ben winning a lot of ball and linking the play up, Panthers started to get a grip of midfield as the game wore on.&nbsp; Still not much in the way of clear chances, more a game for the purist than the thrill-seeking neutral, but good football from both sides and pretty evenly matched.<br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0109pants4.jpg" alt="" height="165" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">With time running out, Panthers began to throw caution to the wind in the last 10 or 15 minutes and the game opened up.&nbsp; Sho latched onto a loose ball and shaped for his trademark lobbed finish but&nbsp; a miscue under pressure from the Celts defence saw the chance go begging.&nbsp; Romen, leading from the front (literally) shot from a tight angle but saw the effort come off the post.&nbsp; With gaps opening up in the Panthers defence, Pete McGill (I think) clipped the bar with a shot from distance but that proved to be the last of the action.&nbsp; A good game played in the right spirit and Celts probably shading it on the balance of play.<br>
										<br>
										Mixed feelings at the end of the game.&nbsp; Satisfaction that we proved that we can compete, but disappointment not to have created more clear-cut chances.&nbsp; Did we give them a bit too much respect? Maybe.&nbsp; Do we need Rick's physical presence back? Probably.&nbsp; Can we cut it at this level?&nbsp; Definitely!&nbsp;<br>
