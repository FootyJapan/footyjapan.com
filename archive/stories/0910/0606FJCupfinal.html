									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, June 6th, 2010</b>.<br>
										At the Cup Final we were trying to get to BFC players on the pitch but we couldn't catch up to any of them, they were running laps around us. Luckily this was pre-kickoff, when they were all kitted out and warming up before most of us arrived, but the message was clear - BFC wanted the hardware, and Hibs were in for another dogfight.<br>
										<br>
										We knew we'd have to match their intensity from the start, but they came out blazing, and all we could do at first was break things up and try to counter. Anyone that held onto the ball on the petite YCAC midfield was immediately smashed, and there were some You-Tube-grade ugly tackles before the refs (Quality all game, and real, neutral linesmen too - in yellow outfits, with flags!) stepped in to calm things down. The Brits were the clear aggressors, but aside from long runs by the slippery Shosuke got little chances for their efforts, as the Hibs back four and midfield held strong.<br>
										<br>
										It was a bit like the rub-a-dub in boxing, every time they left an opening we punched back, and with Andre back in form and tearing up defenders we got clear chances deep in BFC-land. Dre got a well-deserved goal after a clear PK when we won possession, Tomo got through clear and slotted home calmly (his 7th in 6 games, yawn), and Yohei got free at point blank after Dre won the ball yet again, so 3-0 into half.<br>
										<br>
										After every cliche at halftime about not relaxing with a lead, we came out too relaxed and they immediately pinned us in. Shosuke drew another PK (4 in the last 4 games, but he also finally got a yellow for diving) and Carlos fired home to put them on the board, 3-1. It could have been ugly for the green, BFC had another free kick off the cross bar, and drew one of Hitoshi's finest saves of the season, changing direction to dive and tap a ball clear after Evans humped it low at the corner. But Mike and Dave battled all game with Josh putting in a great game at the back, and Dre put it away with his second goal of the night to make it 4-1, as we held them off for our third straight TML Cup, done and done and done, and on to the YCAC bar to celebrate the league double.<br>
