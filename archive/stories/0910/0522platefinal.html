										It was a nice season for the Swiss: A sweet winning streak that brought promotion to Division 1, good performances in the New Year's and Charity 7's and a great turnout of players for the games. The plate would be the icing on the cake: Not the most prestigious title, but a title nonetheless.<br>
										<br>
										The opposition in the final were the Jet 2nds, a team that is still in the run for promotion to the second division and looked like a stronger oppostion than their first team in the semi-final.<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0522Swiss2.jpg" alt="" height="160" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">The Swiss took control early in the game. They played solid around the back and waited patiently for their chances. After about 20 minutes they got the breakthrough: Karl Ring took a shot from about 18 meters out and scored the 1-0. The game went in the right direction.<br>
										<br>
										The Jets 2nds never looked like they would get back into the game after that. The had few attacks and Alex and Nicolas in the Swiss defense made sure that Tomo in goals could spend a mostly quiet afternoon. <br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0522Swiss4.jpg" alt="" height="235" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">But it was only around 15 minutes from time that the Kickers sealed the victory. After a nice attack, Koutaro was fouled in the box and birthday-boy Seiji stepped up to take the penalty kick. He calmly converted to score his first goal for the Swiss Kickers. A couple of minutes later, Aoki played a beautiful pass to Dominique who kept the composure and neatly finished to make it 3-0.<br>
										<br>
										A sunny day, three goals and a bottle of Champagne. What else do you want? Maybe a decent place in Soga to celebrate a victory - but a couple of beers and a 900-Yen hamburger steak in Flying Garden did the trick.<br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/10/0522Swiss.jpg" alt="" height="287" width="475" border="0"><b>Swiss players on the day:</b> Tomo; Philipp, Nicolas, Alex, Seiji;Koutaro, Watanabe, Karl, Dominique; Ben, Aoki; Richard, Gildas<br>
