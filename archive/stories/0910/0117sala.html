									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 17th January.</b><br>
										<br>
										Who would have thought that such a motley crew of briggands, rapscallions and shysters (plus the Vagabonds) could have served up an 8 goal thriller?&nbsp; Not me, that's for sure. But lo and behold this cup classic ended 5-3&nbsp;to Sala&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Vagabonds putting up a great fight.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										2 goals from man of the match, Pete Swinney, and a goal each from Shige, Lenny and Ryotaro earned Sala their place in the last 16 of the cup.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										From the off Vagabonds showed no respect to their&nbsp;division 1&nbsp;opposition, taking&nbsp;the match to them and causing Sala&nbsp;lots of problems with their direct play and their two&nbsp;tricky strikers.&nbsp; In the first 10 minutes&nbsp;they&nbsp;forced several shots and corners but with&nbsp;Clarkey, Ian and Dan marshalling the Sala back line there was no way through, and&nbsp;indeed it was Sala who drew first blood, somewhat against the run of play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sam, sporting fantastic boots which&nbsp;looked like an Adidas designer's wet dream mixed with a pile of snot,&nbsp;was sent tumbling on the edge of the box.&nbsp; Pete clipped the wall with the resultant free kick but it broke to Shige who scored from an angle with the aid of a deflection.&nbsp; <b>1-0 Sala</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Harsh on the Vags for sure, but it was about to get worse.&nbsp; Vags barely had time to dry their eyes and get a can of&nbsp;&quot;toughen the f*ck up&quot; out of the fridge, when&nbsp;Sala scored a slightly fortuitous second.&nbsp; <br>
										<br>
										This time Shige whipped in a corner which Vags failed to clear and everyone's favourite catalogue man, Pete &quot;Swinners&quot; Swinney, clipped it home with&nbsp;an undescribable&nbsp; unorthodox finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it in fact describable&nbsp;because I called it undescribable, or isn't it&nbsp;because I&nbsp;didn't actually explain what he did??&nbsp;&nbsp;A wee brainteaser for you there, sports fans.&nbsp; I'll let you all know next week what AJ and Roddy decide!&nbsp; <b>2-0 Sala</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At this point a lot of teams in the Vags' position would have spat the dummy at the injustices of the beautiful game but all credit to them they didn't.&nbsp; And, with the effects of their cans of &quot;toughen the f*ck up&quot; beginning to kick in, Vags raced up the pitch and&nbsp;got&nbsp;the goal their efforts deserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a jinking dribble their number 11 (?) was invited to shoot and promptly placed a left footer into the bottom corner, from outside the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;2-1 Sala.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sala reacted by getting some of Vagabonds' fighting spirit for themselves and this made a big difference.&nbsp; Sam, Ian&nbsp;and Scotty started getting stuck in more and when Sala's subs, Guido, Lenny and Ryo&nbsp;also made an impact it gave Sala the impetus to wrestle control of the game away from the Vags.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stu, Masa&nbsp;and Lenny had shots from distance before Sala's best move of the match cut Vags open and left Stu&nbsp;with time, a brilliant shooting position and the freedom of the Vags penalty area.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man who&nbsp;is forcing writers to think up new&nbsp;ways of slagging strikers apart from the old classics of &quot;he couldn't score in a brothel&quot; or&nbsp;&quot;he couldn't hit a barn door from a yard with a shovel&quot;&nbsp;slotted the ball a good few yards past the post.&nbsp; Doh!&nbsp;went the tall one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blast went the writers.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Fortunately, Pete was determined to get the next goal for Sala as it was obviously going to be crucial.&nbsp; Showing that touch of class that we all know he has, he played a one two with Ryo then smashed a 25 yarder past the keeper.&nbsp; The keeper got a touch but to no avail.&nbsp; <b>3-1 Sala</b>.<br>
										<br>
										In the second half Lenny started to get some joy down the left for Sala, benifitting from the dominance that Sala were starting to show.&nbsp; With Vags losing the midfield battle their dangerous strikers were seeing a lot less of the ball which was a big loss for them.&nbsp; The fourth Sala goal came soon after.&nbsp; Lenny produced a lovely top corner Phuket 7's-esque finish after Pete had received a pass from Scotty and then played him in.&nbsp; <b>4-1 Sala.</b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Goals were being scored left, right and centre now (unless&nbsp;Stu had the ball), and with&nbsp;Sala looking for an offside, the Vags number 7 raced through and squared to their striker who dinked a&nbsp;quality&nbsp;finish over the onrushing&nbsp;Taylor.&nbsp; <b>4-2 Sala</b>.<br>
										<br>
										Toby&nbsp;was next to feed the famished Lenny Lennerington.&nbsp; Having&nbsp;come short to collect the&nbsp;ball he turned and played in the indefatigable Kiwi, whose shot squirmed under the keeper only for Ryo to poke home from close range.&nbsp; A goal he deserved for the impact his dribbling and speed had had on the game.&nbsp; <b>5-2 Sala</b>.<br>
										<br>
										With a few minutes left there was still enough time for Scotty to fluff&nbsp;a clearance straight to Vags danger man, Steve, who&nbsp;pulled the trigger&nbsp;sending a dipping&nbsp;volley over Taylor for Vags' third goal.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>5-3 Sala&nbsp;at the feep</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>Man of the Match</b> - The man who sold a thousand catalogue sweaters, Pete Swinney.<br>

										<b>Sinner of the&nbsp;Match</b> - The man who missed a thousand catalogued sitters,&nbsp;&quot;Big Bird&quot; Stu Anderson, for his truly bird-like finishing&nbsp; ; )<br>
