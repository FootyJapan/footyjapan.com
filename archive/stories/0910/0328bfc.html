									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 28th March.</b><br>
										<br>
										With 17 goals in their two previous meetings this quarter final meeting of FCI and BFC was always going to an exciting game. Unfortunately for FCI a late arrival meant they took to the pitch without a warm-up and for that they were punished. Within 20 minutes BFC had hit them for 3 unanswered goals each of them coming from typical attacking BFC football played out at speed. To their credit FCI never lay down; they don't know how to and the last 60 minutes of the game were played out in end to end fashion with FCI dominating possession as BFC soaked up the pressure and looked to hit them on the counter.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The first goal came from the head of Duncan Walsh following great work by Taka on the left digging out&nbsp;a pin point cross leaving Walsh with some work to do but work he did well. Minutes later Shosuke is set through by Carlos only to be brought down by the FCI last man - penalty. Carlos makes no mistake from the spot: 2-0 BFC. It's Sho's turn next with&nbsp;a deflected effort that looped into the top corner giving the FCI keeper no chance. FCI did not deserve to be 3-0 down but to BFC's credit they were playing some of their best counter-attacking football of the season.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With 10 minutes to go before half time a flap in the BFC nets led to a soft FCI goal: 3-1 and game on. BFC moved to 4-5-1 for the second half with the aim of locking it up and hoping Sho could nab one on the break. It wasn't to be. A ball across our box from Morson, misjudged by Doyle and then Saco, before Tepi and Gen failed to deal with the ensuing cross only for the FCI striker Mani to head home: 3-2, now it was really game on. I'd say all 5 of the BFC defence must take some blame for that one. Minutes later though Saco made amends for the defence as he headed home a Carlos free kick to put BFC two clear again.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										That was the way it stayed with both sides continuing to attack but both defences up to the job. Particular mention to the FCI number 8, Christophe, who put in a Trojan shift which took all&nbsp;of the&nbsp;BFC's midfielders' resolve to counter.<br>
