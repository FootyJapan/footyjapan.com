									<p><b>Oi Futo 2, Sat 11th Feb.</b> (Designed well by TML matchmakers to eliminate one of us early on), on a cold Sunday night 12 Hibs men showed up for tough cup&nbsp;quarterfinal against&nbsp;the old foe Swiss. Both squads seemed to&nbsp;have only one subs each, it was quite a difficult&nbsp;match at big&nbsp;Oifuto-2 pitch.&nbsp;<br>
										Intended to&nbsp;stop talented Swiss attack,&nbsp;Hibs had changed formation  back to 4-4-2 from usual 3 defenders, Naoki and Jay anchoring center of defence, Mick and Tomo in front of them.&nbsp;<br>
										Kenji and debutante Rob had played left  side,&nbsp;Yasu and Numa played on right,&nbsp;they balanced&nbsp;attack and defence well.&nbsp;KuniK and Yama started up front.<br>
										Hibs started&nbsp;out with a bit of nervousness, Swiss often claiming most of&nbsp;control initially. By&nbsp;result, in a few occasions&nbsp;Swiss came close to scoring as passes and buildups through Hibs defence created shots taken at close range. About 10 munites&nbsp;on&nbsp;Hibs striker Yama goes out with injury, kicked right below&nbsp;his shingard by&nbsp;Swiss late tackler&nbsp;with no card handed out.&nbsp;This called  up&nbsp;Hibs only&nbsp;available substitute&nbsp;Jorgen, who decided to&nbsp;come out&nbsp;in last munite who&nbsp;was not expecting to play a  lot..... but he ended up playing 70 munites instead.<br>
										About midway&nbsp;of first half, some neat passing at outside of Swiss box caused Swiss defenders to tackle KuniK from behind. Rob capitalized on this oppoturnity&nbsp;with his left foot by swirving over the wall from 45 degrees, like&nbsp;he had taken&nbsp;right out from a&nbsp;soccer instruction video&nbsp;on how to do just.&nbsp;However Swiss then had few of their chances before&nbsp;halftime coming close to scoring again.&nbsp;Hibs&nbsp;were lucky to go into halftime up 1-0.&nbsp; <br>
										Right at&nbsp;start of second half, nice buildup from&nbsp;the back&nbsp;had Rob advance into left side, putting low fast cross into a mixer. KuniK ran past two men in Red and tapped  past&nbsp;Swiss keeper Peter for a goal from near post. Hibs&nbsp;goes up 2-0.<br>
										Most  of&nbsp;2nd half was controlled well by Hibs,&nbsp;most of time there were good passing to feet and neat exchanges.&nbsp;there were another oppoturnity as Tomo was given a PK but he decided to make this game interesting by&nbsp;kicking it back to&nbsp;where Peter dove.<br>
										Motivated by Peter's save, Swiss bounced back with&nbsp;energetic run of late,&nbsp;properly rewarded for a&nbsp;goal&nbsp;from 25 meter thump by their Japanese striker&nbsp;with 10 munites to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										At the end, having more than a few men in leg cramps somehow Hibs&nbsp;fended off Swiss attack and prevailed.&nbsp;<b><br>
