														</b>19-teams, a notable number of which were not from the Tokyo Metropolis League, took to the YC&amp;AC turf at the crack of dawn on Wednesday March 21st, 2007, to do battle in the <b>3rd Footy Japan/YC&amp;AC Charity 6&rsquo;s Football Tournament.</b> <br>
														<br>
														The teams taking part were: <b>BFC Reuters 1; YC&amp;AC 1; Yokosuka Seahawks; Lions FC; T&Uuml;V Typhoons; Robert Walters; Wall Street Clash; JAC Japan; Robert Half; Sala FC; CareerCross; Wallabies FC; Azule FC; Amanis FC; PTS Inter Tane FC; Tokyo CSC; Taros; France FC; BFA Seniors.</b><br>
														<br>
														Early results in the group stages were quick to separate the men from the boys and initial conjectures seemed to lean towards the main silverware being snatched by either BFC Reuters 1, Yokosuka Seahawks, Robert Walters or YC&amp;AC 1 &#150; all of whom started off the tournament with gusto, playing other teams off the park and with clearly nothing but winning the cup on their minds (and the fact that through their participation they were, of course, helping to raise money for a very, very worthy cause indeed).<br>
														<br>
														<img src="../../../photos/07/07C6-2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="215" align="right" border="0">
														Surprising to some perhaps, although entirely deserved, it was however Amanis FC (*currently fifth from bottom in TML&rsquo;s 2nd division) who won the main competition with a resounding 3-1 victory over YC&amp;AC. Amanis&rsquo; effervescent Mexican-maestro Jorge Kuriyama also won the <b>Magellan MVP Award</b> for his outstanding efforts both outfield, in goal, on the touchline, at JR Yamate station and, most notably, in Roppongi in the post-tournament celebrations.<br>
														<br>
														<img src="../../../photos/07/07C6-winning_goal.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="200" align="left" border="0">
														Chris Taylor who smashed in Amanis&rsquo; second goal against YC&amp;AC 1 in the final game, is another formidable Amanis player worthy of mention, who was key when it came to their systematic destruction of a YC&amp;AC team who, up until the final game had only conceded 4-goals. It was however through tenacity, sheer determination and some neat finishing that Amanis managed to put 3 past a YC&amp;AC 1 team who, although were holding the game at 1-1 for a while, were simply outrun and outplayed by a team who, before the game kicked off, many on the touchlines considered to be the underdogs. <br>
														<br>
														The eventual winners of the Plate competition were another team from TML&rsquo;s 2nd division who, if they performed in the league like they did at this tournament, surely wouldn&rsquo;t be languishing 2nd from bottom in TML Division 2*. <br>
														<br>
														<img src="../../../photos/07/07C6-3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="158" align="right" border="0">
														Lions FC disposed of a resilient T&Uuml;V Typhoons by a single goal before coming up against the winners of last year&rsquo;s main competition Azule FC &#150; a team comprised of young, speedy Japanese whippersnappers. With chances going astray either end and both keepers and defenders 100% committed to not letting ANYTHING get past them, both teams were struggling to find a way through but Azule FC hit the back of the net after some neat interplay between their two attacking players. Game over it would seem, but game over it was not to be as seconds before the final whistle Lions FC equalized through a very composed strike from youngster Ahmed Gaafar, meaning both teams would have to battle through a further 5-minute golden goal period, which itself ended goalless. Lions FC clinched it in the PK shootout and hopefully the well-earned victory will reinstill the verve and commitment that will see this talented club climbing the ranks of the TML over the coming seasons.<br>

														This charity tournament, since its inception 2-years ago (as a means of raising urgently needed funds to support the victims of the Asian Tsunami), has become possibly the most prestigious and indeed one of the most popular Footy Japan organized small-sided tournaments on the local football calendar - and suffice to say this year all 19-teams were &ldquo;well up for it!&rdquo; <br>
														<br>
														Footy Japan would like to say a big &ldquo;Thank You!&rdquo; to everyone who helped this event to once again be such a wonderful success: The Yokohama Country and Athletic Club, the teams themselves, a special thanks to all the referees and to the sponsors who helped us raise: <b>478,355JPY</b> for <b>UNICEF</b><br>
