Hibs have been somewhat of a bogey team for Sala over the past few seasons, the main reason being their inability to find a way past the intimidating figure of Hitoshi in goals. At the station he looks much like any other bloke but upon donning the orange jersey and stepping across the white line he suddenly becomes an 8 foot tall colossus capable of denying the best strikers in Japan, all of whom happen to play for Sala. <a class="txtlink" href="0428salavhibs.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

															&nbsp;<br>
															The teams took to the field in what footy parlance would be referred to as 'blustery conditions'.&nbsp; Indeed, straight from the kick-off, Armanis rather wisely adopted the Pele tactic of blasting the ball from the half way line, causing no end of problems for the Shane defence. <a class="txtlink" href="0422shanevamanis.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

With YCAC knocked out of the cup competition early on, there's a sense amongst the other finalists that there's everything to play for. In one interesting draw BFC will go up against their very own second team BFC Vagabonds in a match that will undoubtedly see no holds barred. The recent form of Maritizio will certainly give Sala lots to think about in their quarter-final match-up and Celts vs. Geckoes could well be one of the games of the season. <a class="txtlink" href="../../../pages/fjcup.html">Full draw</a> ...<br>

YCAC, the Swiss, Hibs, Sala and BFC arrived fielding notably strong squads, but due to the expansive size of the pitches (causing the 3/4 sized goals to appear as mere specks on the horizon at times) any of the teams who capitalized on their goal-scoring chances, sporadic as they might be, would have a good chance of leaving the competition clutching silverware. <a class="txtlink" href="07fjnewyear7s.html" target="_blank">more</a> ...<br>

														<p><b>Kanda University Sun 8th October 2006.</b> A strong typhoon that brought days of rain, did enough damage to cause the Footy 7's &amp; 6's to be cancelled. This year both tournaments had been relegated to the dirt pitch at KUIS, due to more space being required for childrens games. With a constant barrage of rain on the preceding Wednesday, Thursday &amp; Friday, the pitch was a muddy quagmire and a decision to cancel had to be made. Of course after the cancellation, 'Sod's Law' kicked in and it was sunny all weekend and the Scottish Games themselves went ahead, albeit in gale force winds that flattened tents &amp; sent up dust clouds. Hopefully by next year, KUIS will have an artificial pitch so cancellation won't come into the equation. To make up for the missed 7's, Footy Japan has decided to organize a New Years 7's on the beautiful new turf pitch at Oi Futo on January 7th.
