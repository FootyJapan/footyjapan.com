									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 22nd April.</b> Bob Dylan once sang, &quot;The answers my friend, are blowing in the wind.&quot;&nbsp; Well, it was mainly plastic bags and sand that were blowing in Misato on Sunday as Shane FC took on Armanis for a place in the final of the Footy Japan Plate.&nbsp; <br>
										<img src="../../../photos/07/0422shanevamanis2.jpg" alt="" height="245" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">&nbsp;<br>
										The teams took to the field in what footy parlance would be referred to as 'blustery conditions'.&nbsp; Indeed, straight from the kick-off, Armanis rather wisely adopted the Pele tactic of blasting the ball from the half way line, causing no end of problems for the Shane defence.&nbsp; And Shane's inablity to defend in anything other than a style reminiscent of a scene from Benny Hill led directly to Armanis taking an early two goal lead, as firstly&nbsp;a forward was left completely open at the back post, and then a long through ball was missed entirely, allowing Armanis'&nbsp;pacy forward to score with an excellently placed shot.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										But normality eventually resumed in the Shane&nbsp;defence, and the skilful running of Satoshi coupled with Ichiro's Roberto Carlos style sojourns from left back saw the Grammarians claw themselves back into the game, with Satoshi twisting past a couple defenders to score two remarkably similar goals to make it 2-2.<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/07/0422shanevamanis3.jpg" alt="" height="210" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">&nbsp;<br>
										At which point, Shane promptly imploded yet again, showing alarming inability to deal with the Lawrence Of Arabia style conditions, as Armanis&nbsp;picked up a loose ball from under the legs of a camel to take a 3-2 lead,&nbsp;though that shouldn't take away from what was another excellent finish, leaving this correspondent no chance.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										But conditions were bad for both teams, and the wind caused havoc in the Armanis box, when a defender unluckily swung a boot at a Tom Beakes cross, giving his own keeper no chance.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../photos/07/0422shanevamanis4.jpg" alt="" height="292" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">The second half saw the polar opposite, with Shane FC dominating possession, and forcing Armanis's influential number 10, Jorge, to drop deep into his own defence.&nbsp; Satoshi's running and close control eventually saw Shane take a deserved 4-3 lead, and Mitchell was on hand to bury an open goal after Satoshi (who else?)&nbsp; had hit the post to complete the scoring.&nbsp; Satoshi was going to be allowed to keep the match ball after his hat-trick, but Shane had to rely on a student to buy them a ball, and clearly it was going nowhere.<br>
										<br>
										With Armanis pushing their full-backs into midfield in an attempt to get back into the game, Shane contrived to miss some easy chances, and Armanis's over-worked goalkeeper pulled of a couple of terrific stops before the game came to an end, with Shane probably deserving of going though to the final.<br>
