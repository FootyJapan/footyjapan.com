								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 26th Nov.</b> AFC played this cup game with a noticeably weakened team and despite battling admirably from start to finish were overcome by an &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; YCAC side. YCAC veteran Damian Hart was dropped after provocatively arriving at the game in a pair of tight crocodile skin trousers (this is not a joke - for the love of God why?) as the talented but raw Steve Taw replaced him in the centre of defence (if that is the right word).<br>
									<br>
									AFC identified the YCAC goalkeeper as a potential weak link (fire the scout) and on that basis shot from (very very) long distance on a number of occasions (i.e. every time they had the ball). The tactic almost paid off early in the first half when YCAC keeper Gary Hodgson was, for once, left clawing desperately at fresh air only to see the impressively struck AFC shot crash off the underside of the bar and out. YCAC responded by scoring. <br>
									<br>
									AFC went close again minutes later and were unlucky not to score. After some good approach play out wide and a shot the ball was trickling towards the unguarded YCAC net only for Dickie Philo to clear the ball off the line in a Djimi Traore type spinning manoeuvre.  After that YCAC controlled the game (if not the ball) more effectively and ran out comfortable winners to progress to the next round. That&rsquo;s now six clean sheets in a row for YCAC keeper Gary Hodgson.<br>
									<br>
									The match was notable for Damian Hart&rsquo;s sartorial indiscretions and the four goal contribution of emergency centre forward (some would describe him as an emergency defender as well) and substitute Kevin Morgan (not so much a fox in the box as a drunken, uncoordinated bull in a china shop) which left him as the current YCAC top scorer. Morgan demonstrated a level of skill rarely seen at this level (think Special Olympics preliminary qualifying rounds) and no doubt the very nice Steve Taw will play him up front again as playing at the back is dead boring and rubbish (he better if he knows what&rsquo;s good for him).<br>
									<br>
									AFC deserve credit for fulfilling the fixture and had a number of committed performers, particularly in central defence, but Trent stood out. Best for YCAC were the unselfish Tyson and Anthony. In a not entirely surprising development Damien Hart has been suspended by the TML pending an enquiry into his trousers and will miss the next cup game against the Swiss Kickers. YCAC has decided not to appeal (irrespective of the suspension). The league needs to take a strong stand against this type of behaviour, particularly as a deterrent to others who are also dressed by their wives.<b><br>
